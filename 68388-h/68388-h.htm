</div>

<hr class="r7" />

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> first book of this series, “How to Mesmerise,” gave so
much satisfaction to the reading public, and having passed
into several editions, my publishers have asked me to write
another work on similar lines. This <em>brochure</em> is my response.
Clairvoyance, Psychometry, and Thought Transference—briefly
referred to in the former—are more fully gone into in
this. Consequently, I have little doubt “How to Thought-Read”
will meet with acceptance.</p>

<p>Thought-reading is duly considered and explained. A
clear distinction is drawn between Musculation, or Muscle
and Mind-Reading; and although these pages are not confined
to Thought-Reading, as generally understood by the
public, the subject itself, and as an entertainment, have been
pretty fully dealt with.</p>

<p>During the past decade, psychological subjects have, in a
remarkable way, arrested public attention. “New Mesmerism”
and “New Spiritualism” are popular subjects
with editors and magazine writers. Whatever the real
causes—a greater influx of the spiritual from “the state of
the dead,” or from a reaction in the minds of men against
the purblind materialism of our scientific leaders—it is hard
to say. Possibly these and other causes have been at work.
One thing is certain, for good or ill, the majority of thinking
men and women of the age are not only interested in, but
are actually searching for evidence of “embodied spirit.”
Hence we find men of science, journalists, and even professed
materialists and secularists, who, a few years ago,
could scarcely speak of these subjects in the ordinary <a id="language"></a><ins title="Original has 'lauguage'">language</ins><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
of courtesy, confess now not only their belief, but are going
to the other extreme of advocating, what as yet, they have
failed to fully grasp.</p>

<p>A few years ago “The British Parliament of Science”
was nothing if not materialistic. The leading <em>savants</em> of the
day declared “all was matter, no matter what.” Consequently,
man was the highest product of protoplasm, and
his <em>only</em> destiny the grave. The change has been great
indeed, when one of its most brilliant members (Professor
Oliver Lodge, D.Sc., F.R.S., British Association at Cardiff,
1891) in his address said: “It is familiar that a thought
may be excited on the brain of another person, transferred
thither from our brain by pulling a suitable trigger; by
liberating energy in the form of sound, for instance, or by
the mechanical act of writing, or in other ways. A pre-arranged
code, called language, and a material medium of
communication, are recognised methods. May there not,
also, be an <em>immaterial</em> (perhaps an ethereal) medium of
communication? Is it possible that an idea can be transferred
from one person to another by a process such as we
have not yet grown accustomed to, and know practically
nothing about? <em>In this case I have evidence. I assert I
have seen it done, and am perfectly convinced of the fact;
many others are satisfied of the truth, too.</em> It is, perhaps, a
natural consequence of the community of life or family
relationship running through all living beings. The transmission
of life may be likened in some ways to the transmission
of magnetism, and all magnets are sympathetically
connected, so that, if suitably suspended, a vibration from
one disturbs others, even though they be distant 92,000,000
miles. It is sometimes objected that, granting thought-transference
or telepathy to be a fact, it belongs more
especially to lower forms of life, and that as the cerebral
hemispheres develop we become independent of it; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
what we notice is the relic of a decaying faculty, not the
germ of a new and fruitful sense, and that progress is not to
be made by studying or alluding to it. As well might the
objection be urged against a study of embryology. <em>It may,
on the other hand, be an indication of a higher mode of communication,
which shall survive our temporary connection
with ordinary matter.</em> The whole region is unexplored
territory, and it is conceivable that matter may react on
mind in a way we can at present only dimly imagine.”
The italics are mine.</p>

<p>Thought-Transference and Telepathy may, indeed, be an
indication of a higher mode of communication between
human beings after we have severed our temporary connection
with matter. Whether or not, the hope should repay our
study. I have sought in the following pages to briefly define
and illustrate what these phases of communication are.</p>

<p>Double and Psychic Consciousness, Clairvoyance, natural
and induced; Psychometry, its natural and leading features
as a spiritual faculty; Thought-Transference, visions, dreams,
and their <em>portents</em>, are in turn briefly dealt with, in order to
extract therefrom some evidence of <em>soul</em>.</p>

<p>Modern Spiritualism is referred to, in so far as Thought-Reading
is likely to throw any light upon its psychological
phases, as well as on its physical phenomena.</p>

<p>While attempting to cover so much ground my difficulty
was not what to write, but what not to write, the materials
at my disposal being so abundant. Much has been cut down
to get the whole within reasonable compass. Nevertheless,
I hope my readers will find “How to Thought-Read” a
readable contribution to the science of soul.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Before</span> entering upon the subject of “How to Thought
Read”—or rather, range of interesting subjects grouped
under this title—it is proposed to deal briefly with the
key to the whole, which is to be found in the revelations
of man’s inner life, soul-life and character, presented by
somnambulism and trance, whether natural or induced.</p>

<p>The use of a few simple terms having a well-defined
meaning will help the reader and prepare him for the more
careful study of the psychic side of human life.</p>

<p>The somnambulistic and trance states may be divided, for
the convenience of examination, into the Hypnotic, or state
of hypnosis; the Mesmeric, or somnambulistic; and the
Psychic, or lucid somnambulistic—or briefly, the Hypnotic,
Mesmeric, and Psychic states.</p>

<p>The operator is the controlling agent, hypnotist, or mesmerist;
in spiritualism, the guide or control.</p>

<p>The sensitive is the subject, the percipient, psychic, patient,
or person who passes into the hypnotic, mesmeric, or trance
states, etc.</p>

<p>Hypnosis is the term used for the hypnotic state artificially
induced by the agent. Hypnosis is the lowest rung of the
ladder; the psychic or soul state the highest. The intermediate
phases, as indicated in conscious or sub-conscious
conditions of life, are innumerable and not readily classified.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Still, the states mentioned will give a favourable insight to
the whole. In hypnosis, physical rather than mental phenomena
are evolved; <em>anæsthesia</em>, or non-sensitiveness to pain,
is more or less present. The senses of smell and hearing are
partially exalted, and the sensitive may be partially or wholly
unconscious.</p>

<p>The mesmeric state is the term frequently used to denote
ordinary artificial somnambulism. It is actually the higher
or more perfect form of hypnosis. The senses in this state
are more fully submerged, and the mental faculties are more
fully exalted, than in hypnosis.</p>

<p>The psychic state, as the mesmeric, relates to the mental,
and hypnosis to the more physical, so does the psychic
state refer to that class of extraordinary somnambulism in
which the mental and the spiritual gifts transcend in character
and power those of the foregoing states. In this state the
higher phenomena of lucid somnambulism, clairvoyance, and
thought-transference are manifested more perfectly than in
any other.</p>

<p>The hypnotic, the mesmeric, and the psychic states
indicated are frequently interlinked in manifestation. The
sensitive may pass from the first to the last without apparent
gradation. It is well to keep these divisions in thought,
so that in practice no one will be content with the <em>lower</em>
where it is possible, by wise and judicious observations and
operations, to induce the higher.</p>

<p>To make the matter still more clear, in hypnosis and in
the mesmeric state all phenomena may be said to be induced
through and by the influence and the direction of the operator.
Not that he produces the effects as they are exhibited by
the sensitive, but they are brought about through the agency
of his suggestions or operations.</p>

<p>In the psychic state this is not always the case. The
influence of the operator may at times be almost <em>nil</em>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
operator will find it best—when the sensitive is in a high
lucid state—to become an observer and a learner, and no
longer continue the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i> of director.</p>

<p>In the psychic state, the soul-powers, so often submerged in
ordinary life, transcend in a remarkable manner. The senses
are completely suspended and the mind exalted to such
a degree, a clearly defined super-sensuous condition is
reached. Whether this stage or condition is induced by
fasting, prayer, disease, or by mesmeric agencies, matters
little. In it we find the key to the seership, and the clairvoyance,
and the prophetic utterance, and the mystic powers
attributed to and exercised by prophet, and seer, and sybil
in the past. By the investigation of the phenomena evolved
by the psychic state we are enabled to understand something
of man’s soul or spiritual nature, apart from the phenomena
induced by pathological conditions of brain and body.</p>

<p>The foregoing view presented of mesmeric conditions may
be very different from that which medical men may glean
from hypnotic practice with hysterical and lobsided patients,
and certainly not the views which the general public are
likely to gather from seeing a number of paid “subjects”
knocked about a music hall stage by an ignorant showman.</p>

<p>From the roughest to the finest, from matter to spirit,
from hypnosis to the psychic state, we find enough to arrest
attention and give a high degree of seriousness and earnestness
to our investigation. We stand on the threshold of
soul, and the place where we stand is holy ground. We
find, as is the physical, mental, and spiritual characteristics
of the operator, <em>plus</em> those of the sensitive or sensitives, so
will be the nature of the phenomena evolved.</p>

<p>It will be observed some subjects never get beyond the
first state, or hypnosis; others that of the second, or mesmeric.
All sensitives, in keeping with their temperamental and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
mental developments (as revealed by phrenology and psychometry),
are better adapted for one class of phenomena
than that of others.</p>

<p>It may be further observed that the foregoing states may
be self-induced or, directly and indirectly, the product of
“spirit-control,” drugs, or bodily disease. Hypnosis, we
must bear in mind, although not unlike the mesmeric state,
has no more relation to that condition than sleep produced
by an exhaustive walk or a dose of laudanum is like natural
or healthy sleep. Indeed, hypnosis is not properly a condition
of sleep. In the majority of cases the sensitive is
never wholly unconscious. It is rather a state in which there
is a temporary perversion or subordination between brain
impressions and consciousness. The sensitive in hypnosis
is often less intelligent than in the normal or waking
state.</p>

<p>For various reasons the state of hypnosis may be recognised
as that state in which the mind is subjected to certain
abnormal conditions of the body, notably of the brain, spinal
cord, and indirectly of the circulation, induced by certain
means determined upon by the operator. The mental
condition in this state is one of almost pure automatism, in
which hallucination or sense illusions are more or less
present.</p>

<p>Great and serious are the responsibilities of those who
bring about the state of hypnosis. Every thought and
feeling, of whatever kind, infused in this state, like seed,
will take root and germinate, and finally bud into action in
the daily or waking consciousness, and determine unconsciously
for the sensitive the character of his life. Hypnotism
is neither for indiscriminate use, nor is hypnosis to be induced
as a plaything for the thoughtless—medical or lay. At the
same time, in the hands of the thoughtful, its educative value
is most important, for, if the operator is well poised, and feels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
that, he can impart higher thoughts and strengthen the will<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
of the sensitives by the twofold agencies of impressionability
and suggestion. This is something not to be despised. It
is surely no degradation to be saved from evils one cannot
overcome or resist, unless assisted by external aid, even
though that help can only come by submitting to hypnotism.</p>

<p>In hypnosis the outer brain of convoluted grey matter is
most affected, being more or less denuded of arterial and
nervous stimuli. The power of conscious, intellectual, and
abstract thought is reduced to a minimum. The organs of
the central brain are differently influenced, as in inverse
ratio the stimulation is increased. The eye is more susceptible
to light, or the pupils may become dilated and
fixed. The auditory sense is rendered more keen. The
olfactory powers are intensified, and there is more or less
insensibility of feeling. The powers of co-ordination and
locomotion are preserved up to a certain stage, when these
functions are disturbed, all power of voluntary movement
ceases, lethargic and cataleptic symptoms supervene.</p>

<p>It was by observing, more particularly, hypnosis, Professor
Heidenhain was led to aver “inhibition” actually accounted
for all phases of hypnotism. This opinion has evidently
been based on a limited number of cases. “No inhibition,”
says Dr. Drayton, “however ingeniously applied, will explain
all the phenomena of magnetism. If the personal consciousness,
the individuality, of the subject has been lost, and his
state is that of automatism, or rather that of an involuntary
actor, certainly his cerebral functions operate in a manner
entirely distinct from that which is characteristic in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
ordinary state. The inhibition relates to his common order
of conduct mentally, while the super-sensitivity and extraordinary
play of faculty that he may exhibit, indicate a
higher phase of sensory activity, more free or harmonious
co-ordination of the cerebral functions. The brakes are off,
hence the phenomena that are frequently observed in the
somnambulist, and awaken wonder, because so much out of
keeping with what is known of his common life.”</p>

<p>Here we find doctors—experts in hypnotism or mesmerism—agree
to differ. They agree in this, albeit not expressly
stated, they are alike positive and decided in their views,
and certainly <em>without being positive, there is no possible
success as an operator</em>.</p>

<p>The mistake they make evidently arises in confounding
the two states (hypnosis and the mesmeric), one with the
other. There is no super-sensitivity, or extraordinary play
of faculty in hypnosis, whatever there may be in the
mesmeric state. They are similar, in that they may be both
induced by the reduction of the activity of the cerebral
cortex.</p>

<p>In hypnosis the mind slumbers and dreams. The dream-life
appears as substantial to the sensitive as the waking
life. The life creations, thus dreamed of, are acted upon,
whether they arise from suggestion or other causes.</p>

<p>In the mesmeric state the senses slumber, and the mind
awakens to a fuller enfranchisement of existence, and to
the exhibition of mental and spiritual powers not hitherto
suspected.</p>

<p>In the lower stages the increased power of the senses is
to be found in the <em>intense concentration</em> of effort, brought
about from the fact that the subject’s attention is, and his
whole energies are, directed in one line of action or thought,
to the exclusion of mind or brain activity in other directions.
Hence all efforts are centred in the direction suggested by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the operator, or self-induced, as suggested by the “dominant
idea.”</p>

<p>The sensitive exhibits powers of mind and ability of thought
which were not noticeable in the ordinary waking condition.
Not because he really possesses greater powers of mind or
body, but because of the lack of concentration in the waking
state. By this concentration of direction, so called abnormal
feats of strength are performed, rigidity of structure brought
about, and other characteristics not peculiar to common
life. In a higher sense, we see the sensitive passing from
this condition of concentration of one-idea-ism to a spiritual
state, in which the phenomena exhibited are no longer the
product of self-dethronement and of suggestion. Higher
still, we see the soul reign supreme. The sensitive possesses
a clear consciousness of what is transpiring at home and
abroad, according to the direction of his psychic powers.</p>

<p>In the psychic state—the more perfect trance state or
control—the whole mind becomes illumined; past, present,
and future become presentable to the mind of the lucid
somnambulist as one great whole. This higher stage may
be reached through the simple processes of manipulation, and
passes as suggested in my little work, “How to Mesmerise.”</p>

<p>In the mesmeric state the sensitive passes from the mere
automatism of the earlier stages of hypnosis to the distinct
individuality indicated above, although still more or less
influenced or directed by his controller or operator into the
line of thought and train of actions most desired.</p>

<p>The difference between the hypnotic and mesmeric states
should now be very clear. In the former the sensitive has
no identity, in the latter his identity is preserved in a clearly
individualised form throughout the whole series of abnormal
acts. Whenever the sensitive enters this condition his personal
consciousness is most apparent in the middle and
higher stages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p>In fact, in the mesmeric state, it is very stupid for some
operators to ask the sensitive, “Are you asleep?” It may
be understood what is meant, yet the question is absurd from
the standpoint of an intelligent observer. The sensitive is
never more awake. The higher the state the greater the
wakefulness and lucidity of the inner or soul life.</p>


<h3>THE SIXTH SENSE.</h3>

<p>In the mesmeric state we see developed what Lord Kelvin
(Professor Thomson, of Glasgow University), Drs. Baird,
Hammond, and Drayton call the magnetic sense—or “sixth
sense.” It is a gift of super-sensitiveness. To my mind it
is something more, the enfranchisement of the soul, the
human ego—in proportion as the dominance of the senses is
arrested.</p>

<p>In blindness, it has been noticed how keen the sense of
touch becomes. I have also noticed the keen sensitiveness
of facial perception enjoyed by some of the blind, by which
they are enabled to perceive objects in the absence of physical
sight. In the mesmeric state we see a somewhat analogous
mental condition. As the peculiar sense of the blind is
developed by extra concentration of the mind in the direction
of facial perception, so is “the sixth sense” developed by
concentration of direction, as well as by the condition of
sensitiveness induced by the mesmeric state.</p>

<p>This newly recognised sense, “the sixth sense,” not only
answers the purpose of sight and hearing, but transcends all
senses in vividness and power. Materialists, no longer able
to ignore the phenomena of somnambulism and trance, and
compelled to admit man’s avenues of knowledge in this life
were not confined to the recognised five senses, are good
enough to give him a “sixth sense,” even while they deny
him a soul. In the same way, no longer able to deny the
existence of mesmerism, they now admit it to consideration—re-baptised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
as hypnotism. The phenomena being admitted,
we will not quarrel over the names by which they are
called.</p>


<h3>PSYCHIC-CONSCIOUSNESS.</h3>

<p>As we advance in our investigations we find in the higher
conditions of these states a double or treble consciousness or
memory. The higher including and overlapping the lower.
Thus the consciousness of the hypnotic state includes that
of the waking state, while the memory of the waking state
possesses no conscious recollection of what has taken place
in hypnosis, and so on, each stage has its own phases of
consciousness. The memory of the sensitive, under influence,
overlapping and including the memory of ordinary
or normal life.</p>

<p>Strange as it may appear, there are no phenomena which
have been evolved in any of these abnormal conditions of life,
which have not been observed again and again in ordinary or
normal life, as well authenticated instances of dreams,
warnings, and telepathy testify.</p>

<p>Dr. Richardson notwithstanding, “in dreams and visions
of the night” God has manifested himself to man in all ages.
In other words, the soul (in sleep and analogous states to
somnambulism and trance) comes more in touch with
the sub-conscious or soul sphere of thought and existence.
At times there is an inrush from that sphere into our present
conscious state, by which we know of things which could
not otherwise be known. Of dreams, our space will not
admit more than occasional reference, we may mention as a
case in point the dream of Mrs. Donan, wife of the livery
stableman from whom Dr. Cronin hired his horse in Chicago.
A week before Dr. Cronin was murdered this lady had a
dream-vision, and dreamt he was barbarously murdered, and
saw in a vision the whole terrible scene. This dream was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
means, first, of forewarning the doctor, and second, of
leading to the detection of the miscreants.</p>

<p>Of premonitions, an incident reported in the <cite>Register</cite> of
Adelaide, will suffice:—“Constable J. C. H. Williams has
reported to headquarters that he had an unpleasant experience
at about midnight on Monday. He was on duty at the government
offices in King William Street, and while standing at the
main entrance he had a presentiment that he was in danger,
and walked away a few steps. Scarcely had he moved from
the spot, when a portion of the cornice work at the top of
the building fell with a crash on the place where he had
been standing. The piece of plaster must have weighed
fully a stone, and had it struck Williams the result would
doubtless have been fatal. A passer-by saw the constable a
few minutes after, and his scared looks and agitated manner
clearly showed that his story was true.” Concerning telepathy,
Mrs. Andrew Crosse, the distinguished widow of the
famous electrician, relates in <cite>Temple Bar</cite> an anecdote
about the late Bishop Wilberforce, to the effect, the Bishop
was writing a dry business letter one day, when a feeling of
acute mental agony overcame him and he felt that some evil
had befallen his favourite son, a midshipman in the navy.
The impression was correct. On that very day the lad, who
was with his ship in the Pacific, had been wounded and
nearly bled to death. When this was told Hallam, the
historian, he replied that a very similar thing had happened
to himself. A few cases are noted further on. Some persons
would repudiate <em>all</em> such incidents as accidents or coincidences;
while others would fly to the extreme, and declare all such are
the result of “spirit control”—that is, some disembodied but
friendly spirit projected the dream, conveyed the warning, or
telepathically despatched the news. But we must never forget
news has to be received as well as despatched. Consequently,
we, as embodied spirits, must possess psychic consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p>I believe that <em>much</em> of the phenomena, directly and indirectly
attributed to disincarnate spirit control, are traceable
to <em>no other source</em> than the powers of our own embodied
spirits, as revealed by the facts of somnambulism and
trance, and this is the opinion of all intelligent spiritualists.</p>

<p>“Because,” says Mr. G. H. Stebbins, a prominent
investigator of modern spiritualism in the United States
“a person quotes from books he never saw, or <em>tells of what
he never knew</em> in any external way, that is not final proof
that he is under an external spirit control. Psychometry and
clairvoyance may sometimes solve it all.”</p>

<p>“I hold,” says Mr. Myers, “that telepathy and clairvoyance
do, in fact, exist—telepathy, a communication
between incarnate mind and incarnate mind, and perhaps
between incarnate minds and minds unembodied; clairvoyance,
a knowledge of things terrene which over-passes
the limits of ordinary perception, and which, perhaps,
achieves an insight with some other than terrene world.”</p>

<p>These are the cautious admissions of eminent investigators
in psychical research.</p>


<h3>DOUBLE OR SUB-CONSCIOUSNESS.</h3>

<p>“There are two sets,” says Dr. Brown-Sequard, “a double
state of mental powers in the human organism, essentially
differing from each other. The one may be designated as
ordinary conscious intelligence; the other, a superior power,
which controls our better nature.”</p>

<p>J. Balfour Brown, in his “Medical Jurisprudence,” says:—“In
no case of pure somnambulism, waking consciousness of
the individual knows anything of the sleeping consciousness.
It is as if there were two distinct memories.”</p>

<p>This double-consciousness, memory, or sub-state of mental
powers, is another but lower phase of psychic-consciousness,
and is sometimes exhibited by accidents, and also by disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Abercromby relates the case of a boy, four years old
who was trepanned for a fracture of the skull. He was in a
<em>complete stupor</em> during the operation, and was not conscious
of what took place. At fifteen he became seriously ill of
fever. In the delirium occasioned by the fever, he gave a
correct description of the operation, <em>and of all the persons
present, their dress</em>, manners, and actions, to the minutest
particulars. The “superior power” must have obtained
this knowledge in some other way than through the ordinary
channels of the outward senses.</p>

<p>In cases of apparent drowning, where the person has been
saved from death by active, external help, we have been
informed that the human mind has worked with a rapidity
of action not thought possible in the waking state, the
intensity of menial action being increased in adverse ratio
to the inaction of the external senses and consciousness. In
this state the career of a lifetime has been reviewed, conversations,
actions, persons seen and places visited, all
vividly brought to mind—in possibly less time than it
takes to pen this paragraph. These phenomena suggest
the reflection that the daily waking life—sensuous and
worldly-minded—is possibly, to many, the least real and
effective. How much our external life is influenced by
our unconscious (to us in the waking state) sub-life, is an
interesting problem.</p>

<p>Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes says:—“The more we
examine the mechanism of thought, the more we shall
see that the automatic and unconscious action of the mind
enters largely into all its processes. We <em>all</em> have a <em>double</em>
who is wiser and better than we, who puts thoughts into our
heads and words into our mouths.”</p>

<p>A commercial gentleman of my acquaintance, who was
rather sceptical on the subject of double-consciousness—although,
“notwithstanding,” he said, “Mr. Stead, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
<cite>Review of Reviews</cite>, had turned an honest penny out of
ghosts, double-consciousness, and that sort of rubbish”—admitted
to me, he had a maid, who had an awkward
habit of rising in her sleep, carefully setting the fires, cleaning
and dusting out the rooms, setting the breakfast table,
and doing many other things which appeared important to
the servant-mind. Her movements were watched. She
slipped about with eyes closed, avoiding obstacles, and
doing her work systematically and neatly, and without fuss,
when done, she would go to bed. In the morning she had no
recollection of what she had said or done. It was a curious
thing, he had to admit. The girl was honest enough. He was
certain this habit had not been simulated. Threats of discharge,
and possible loss of wages, did not cure her of this
habit. There was a certain form of “double consciousness”
in this case.</p>

<p>“The subliminal consciousness” of Mr. Myers, by which
he accounts for the phenomena of genius, is but another way
of expressing the concept of an “identity underlying all
consciousness,” the psyche, the real “I, me,” “the superior
power which directs and controls our better nature,” the
“double who is wiser and better than we,” the reality of
which is so much hidden from our ordinary experience,
because our soul-life is so much buried out of sight by the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">débris</i> of the “things of this life,” which, fortunately or
otherwise, pre-occupy so much of our attention.</p>

<p>It is this “subliminal consciousness” we see manifested in
the psychic state, and natural somnambulism. Clairvoyance,
psychometry, thought transference, etc., are as so many spectrum
rays of the one soul light. Call them “subliminal” if you
will. These rays flow out from the soul, and are many-hued,
distinct or blurred, according to the degree of pureness or
super-sensitivity of the external corporeal prism through
which they are projected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p>Persons have lived for years, we are credibly informed,
who have spent half their lives entranced, <em>in the alternation
of two distinct individualities</em> or two distinct states of consciousness,
in one of which they forget all they had learned
or did in the other.</p>

<p>Professor Huxley described (British Association of Science,
Belfast, 1874) a case in which two separate lives, a normal,
and abnormal one, seemed to be lived at intervals by the
same individual during the greater portion of her life.</p>

<p>The conclusion to the whole matter is—the psychic, or
soul-powers in some persons are less entrammelled by the
senses than in others; that a high degree of organic sensitiveness
always accompanies those who are recognised as
psychics or sensitives; that this state of sensitiveness is natural
to some, and in others may be developed by accident, disease,
or induced by somnambulism and trance.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to show these psychic characteristics, or
soul gifts, underlie, and enter into the varied phenomena—clairvoyance,
psychometry, thought transference, thought-reading,
and what not, which are collated under the title of,</p>

<span class="smcap">Clairvoyance.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">What</span> is clairvoyance? “The term, clairvoyance,” says
Dr. George Wyld, in a paper read before the Psychical
Research Society, London, “is French, and means <em>clear-seeing</em>,
but it appears to me to be an inadequate term,
because it might signify clear optical vision, or clear mental
vision. What is signified by the term is the power which
certain individuals possess of seeing external objects under
circumstances which render <a id="the"></a><ins title="Original has 'she'">the</ins> sight of these objects impossible
to physical optics. In short, by clairvoyance, we
mean the power which the <em>mind</em> has of seeing or knowing
thoughts and psychical conditions, and objects hidden from
or beyond the reach of the physical senses; and if the
existence of this faculty can be established, we arrive at a
demonstration that man has a power within his body as yet
unrecognised by physical science—a power which is called
soul, or mind-seeing, and for the description of such a power
the term might be auto-nocticy (αυτονοητικος), or psychoscopy.”
Psychoscopy, or soul sight, would, perhaps, be the better
term. I propose to use the old term—clairvoyance—as it
signifies, in popular usage, the power of seeing beyond the
range of physical vision, as we know it.</p>

<p>That certain persons are endowed with this faculty of clear
seeing—in some of its various phases—is a matter settled
beyond dispute. What special name to call this faculty, or
what are the true causes of its existence; why it should be
possessed by some persons and not by others; why it should
be so frail and fugitive in the presence of some people, and
strong and vivid before others; why some persons are never
clairvoyant until they have been through the mesmeric and
psychic states; why some become possessed of the faculty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
through disease; while, with others, the gift of clairvoyance
appears to be a spontaneous possession; and why some
operators are successful in inducing clairvoyance, and others
not, etc., are interesting questions to which the student of
psychology may, with advantage, direct his attention.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance is soul-sight—the power of the soul to see.
It is the state of refined psychic perception. This state
increases in lucidity—clearness and power of penetration—in
proportion as the activity of the physical senses are
reduced below normal action. It is observed to be most
effective in the trance state—natural or induced—as in the
mesmeric and psychic states. I conclude, then, clairvoyance
depends upon the unfolding of the spirit’s perception, and
is increased in power as the ascendency of the spirit arises
above the activities of the spirit’s corporeal envelope—the
body. In proportion to the spirit’s ascendency over the
organs and senses of the body, is this psychic gift perfect or
imperfect.</p>

<p>The large brain or cerebrum is the physical organ of the
soul, as the cerebellum is of the physiological brain functions.
Mental functions are manifested by the former, and physical
functions by the latter.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance, as a spiritual faculty, will doubtless have its
appropriate organ in the brain. I do not profess to locate
that organ. At the same time I have noticed the best
clairvoyants are wide and full between the eyes, showing
there is a particular fulness of the frontal cerebral lobes, at
their juncture at the root of the nose. This may be something
more than a mere physiognomic sign. When this sign
is accompanied by refinement of organisation, and a fine type
of brain, I always look for the possible manifestation of
clairvoyance in mesmeric subjects.</p>

<p>Some writers are of the opinion clairvoyance is actually
soul-sight, more or less retarded in lucidity by the action or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
activity of the bodily senses. Others believe it to be a
state arising from a peculiar highly-strained nervous condition,
which induces the state of super-sensitivity or
impressionability of the organisation. The first may be
termed the spiritual, and the latter the physiological
hypothesis. But, as a matter of fact, both conditions are
noted. The latter may account for much, and possibly is
sufficient to explain much that is called thought-reading—so
often mistaken for clairvoyance. It does appear to me
that certain peculiar physiological conditions, varying from
semi-consciousness to profound trance, are necessary for the
manifestation of clairvoyance, even when it takes place in
apparently normal life of the possessor.</p>

<p>It is more than likely that the ornate and mystic ceremonies
indulged in by Hindoo mystics, Egyptian, Grecian,
and Roman priests, had the one grand end in view—viz., to
induce the requisite state of super-sensitivity, and thus prepare
the consecrated youths, sybils, and vestal virgins for the influx
of spiritual vision, prophecy, and what not. When this subtle
influx came—by whatever name called—the phenomena
manifested were pretty much the same as we know them,
only varied in degree. The gods spoke per oracle, Pythean,
or Delphic. The man of God either coronated a king or
foretold the end of a dynasty. St. Stephen saw Christ, St.
John beheld visions, Joan of Arc was directed, Swedenborg
illumined, and religious ecstatics in ancient and modern
times partook more or less of the sacred fire—the inner sight.
This (stripped of the fantastic surroundings, priestly mummeries,
and dominant belief of the times) simply indicated
the evolution and exercise of clairvoyance and other psychic
gifts.</p>

<p>Coming nearer home, we hear of the mysterious visions at
the Knock, and at Lourdes. Miraculous appearances of the
Virgin and winged angels, to cheer the hearts of the faithful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and to cause the heads of the scornful to rejoice in sceptical
derision. Then we have all the vagaries produced by the
high nervous tension of modern revivalism, in which the
visions seen are but a transformation of church and chapel
dogmas into objective realities. These illusionary visions—mistaken
for clairvoyance—possess less reality than the
delusive fancies of the sensitive in the state of hypnosis.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance will be governed by its own spiritual laws, just
as sight is affected or retarded by physical conditions. What
these spiritual laws are we can only surmise, but this we may
safely conjecture—viz., that soul-sight is not trammelled or
limited by the natural laws which govern physical optics.
Clairvoyance and physical vision are absolutely distinct, and
possess little in common.</p>

<p>To illustrate a new subject, it is permissible to draw upon
the old and the well-known. So I venture to illustrate clairvoyance
by certain facts in connection with ordinary human
vision. Although some children see better than others, the
power to see, with the ability to understand the relative
positions and uses of the things seen, is a matter of
development. In psychic vision, we also see growth or
development, with increasing power to use and understand
the faculty. Some children are blind from birth, and
others, seeing, lose the power of sight. Many are <em>blind</em>,
although they have physical sight, they see not with <em>the
educated eye</em>. Many, again, have greater powers of sight
than they are aware of. As so it is with psychic vision.</p>

<p>What is true of the physical is also true of the psychic.
From the first glimmerings, to the possession of well-defined
sight, a period of growth and time elapses. From the first
incoherent cry of infancy to well defined and intelligent
speech of manhood, we notice the same agencies at work.
Not only is clairvoyant vision generally imperfect at first, but
the psychic’s powers of description are also at fault. St. Paul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
could not give utterance to what he saw, when caught up to
the third heavens. His knowledge of things and powers of
speech failed him to describe the startling, the new, and the
unutterable. He had a sudden revelation of the state of
things in a sphere which had no counterparts in his previous
experience, in this—his known—world. Hence, although he
knew of his change of state, he could give no lawful or
intelligible expression to his thoughts.</p>

<p>Between the first incongruous utterances, and apparent
fantastic blunderings, and the more mature period in which
“things spiritual” can be suitably described in our language,
to our right sense of things, or comprehension, a period of
development and education must elapse. It is true some
clairvoyants develop much more readily than others.</p>

<p>In the entrancement of the mesmeric and psychic states,
there is a lack of external consciousness. The soul is so far
liberated from the body as to act independently of the ordinary
sensuous conditions of the body, and sees by the perception
and light of the inner or spiritual world, as distinct from the
perception and light of this external or physical world.
Elevated, or rather, liberated into this new condition, the
clairvoyant loses connection with the thrums and threads of the
physical organism, and is unable, or forgets for a time, how
to speak of things as they are, or as they would appear to
the physical vision of another. It is not surprising that in
the earlier stages of clairvoyant development, and consequent
transfer of ordinary consciousness and sensuous perception to
that of spiritual consciousness and perception, the language
of the clairvoyant should appear peculiar, incongruous,
and “wanting,” according to our ideas of clearness and
precision.</p>

<p>One important lesson may be learned from this—viz., the
operator should never force results, or strive to develop
psychic perception by short cuts. Time must be allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
the sensitive, for training and experience, and the development
of self-confidence and expression.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance is not a common possession. Nevertheless,
I believe there are many persons who possess the faculty
unknown to themselves. By following out patiently, for a
time, the requisite directions, the possession of this invaluable
psychic gift might be discovered by many who now appear
totally devoid of any clairvoyant indications. Its cultivation
is possible and, in many ways, desirable.</p>

<p>“The higher attainment,” says Dr. John Hamlin Davey,
“of occult knowledge and power, the development of intuition,
the psychometric sense, clairvoyant vision, inner
hearing, etc., etc., thus reached, so open the avenues to a
higher education, and enlarge the boundaries of human
consciousness and activity, as to fairly dwarf into insignificance
the achievements of external science.”</p>

<p>Clairvoyance is as old as mankind, but the exhibition
of clairvoyance, induced by mesmeric processes, was first announced
by Puysegeur, a favourite pupil of Mesmer, in 1784.
Since that time to the present not only have remarkable
cases of clairvoyance cropped up, but there have been few
mesmerists of any experience who have not had numerous
cases under observation. Clairvoyance converted Dr. John
Elliotson, F.R.S., one of the most scientific of British
physicians, from extreme materialistic views to that of belief
in soul and immortality. The same may be said of the late
Dr. Ashburner, who was one of the Queen’s physicians.
Dr. Georget, author of “Physiology of the Nervous System,”—who
was at one time opposed to a belief in the existence
of a transcendental state in man,—found upon
examination of the facts and incidents of artificial somnambulism,
that <em>his materialism must go</em>. In his last will and
testament, referring to the above-mentioned work, he says:—“This
work had scarcely appeared, when renewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
meditations on a very extraordinary phenomenon, somnambulism,
no longer permitted me to entertain doubts
of the existence within us, and external to us, of an
intelligent principle, altogether different from material
existences; in a word, of the soul and God. With
respect to this I have a profound conviction, founded
upon facts which I believe to be incontestable.” Dr.
Georget directed this change of opinion should have full
publicity after his death.</p>

<p>Space would not suffice me to mention the names of all
the highly educated and refined minds, in the medical,
literary, philosophic, and scientific walks of life, who have
studied these phenomena, and who, like Dr. Georget, have
no more doubts of their reality than they have of their own
physical existence, status, or reputation. Among medical
men—some of whom I have known and corresponded with—might
be mentioned Sir James Simpson, Drs. Elliotson,
Ashburner, Esdaile, Buss, Garth Wilkinson, Hands, Wyld,
Hitchman, Eadon, and Davey. Among others on the roll
of fame, might be noticed Archbishop Whately; Earls Ducie,
Stanhope, Macclesfield, <a id="Charleville"></a><ins title="Original has 'Charlville'">Charleville</ins>; the present Duke of
Argyle; Lord R. Cavendish, Lord Lindsay; Burton, the
traveller; and the late Sergeant Cox. Among literary men,
Mr. Gladstone, Britain’s foremost statesman and scholar;
Mr. Balfour, his able and talented opponent; Bulwer
Lytton, Marryat, Neal, Robert Chambers, Dickens, and
Stevenson, of “Dr. <a id="Jekyll"></a><ins title="Original has 'Jykell'">Jekyll</ins> and Mr. Hyde” fame. Mr.
George Combe, the distinguished Scottish metaphysician,
philosopher, author, phrenologist, etc., was profoundly
interested in the phenomena. Among well-known men
of science might be mentioned <a id="Camille"></a><ins title="Original has 'Camillie'">Camille</ins> Flammarion,
the French astronomer; Fichte, the German philosopher;
Professors Tornebom and Edland, Swedish physicists;
Professor Oliver Lodge, D.Sc., F.R.S.; Alfred Russell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
Wallace, D.C.L., LL.D.; William Crookes, F.R.S.;
Cromwell F. Varley, F.R.S. Notwithstanding this somewhat
formidable array of investigators of clairvoyance,
many good people will not hesitate to deny the value of
such evidence, and yet will believe anything in its favour
which may be found in the Bible, as to its existence in
the <em>past</em>. It is a strange perversion of judgment—not at all
surprising—when the majority take (second-hand) for their
religious(?) views whatever is recognised as “sound” in each
particular district and Church. It is not a question of belief,
it is “a question of evidence,” as Mr. Gladstone avers.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. MʽKinnon, late pastor of Chalmers’ Free
Church, Glasgow, told me a short time ago, “Clairvoyance
was nothing more than a high nervous concentrated form of
mental vision,” to which I replied, “Admitting the hypothesis—which,
however, explained nothing—it matters little what
clairvoyance is esteemed to be or called, if the facts connected
with it are acknowledged.” Even this friend
admitted he knew a man in Mull, who lived on the half croft,
next to his father’s croft. This man had great repute in
that district as “having the Second Sight.” Whatever
this man foretold always came to pass. One instance
will suffice. He (Mr. MʽKinnon) remembered that one day,
while this crofter (who was a tailor by trade) was working,
he suddenly stopped, and looked <em>out into vacancy</em>—as he
always did when the “Second Sight was on him”—and <a id="described"></a><ins title="Original has 'discribed'">described</ins>
a funeral coming over the hill, the mourners, who
they were, and numbers, the way the procession took, and
the name of the “man whose face was covered,” and finally,
when the procession would appear. Mr. MʽKinnon’s parents
noted the time, and being simple Highland folk, accustomed
to the accuracy of this man’s visions, they believed what
he said, and kept his saying in their hearts till the time of
fulfilment came about. Mr. MʽKinnon assured me “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
funeral took place to the day and hour, twelve months subsequently
to the vision, as predicted.” All I can say is,
if “a high nervous concentrated form of mental vision”
<a id="is"></a><ins title="Original has 's'">is</ins> capable of pointing out all this, it is worthy of investigation.
It is evident this tailor at least had a power of
vision—prevoyance—not of the ordinary, everyday kind of
vision. Second sight, as exhibited in this case, is what
may be termed spontaneous clairvoyance.</p>

<p>Epes Sargent, in his work, “The Scientific Basis of Spiritualism,”
referring to clairvoyance, says: “As far as I have
admitted it as part of a scientific basis (demonstrating
man’s spiritual nature), it is the exercise of the supersensual
faculty of penetrating opaque and dense matter as if by the
faculty of sight. But it does more. It detects our unuttered,
undeveloped thoughts; it goes back along the past, and
describes what is hidden; nay, the proofs are overwhelming
that it may pierce the future, and predict coming events from
the shadows they cast before.</p>

<p>“What is it that sees without the physical eyes, and without
the assistance of light? What is normal sight? It is not
the vibrating ether—it is not the external eye—that sees.
It is the soul using the eye as an instrument, and light as
a condition. Prove once that sight can exist without the use
of light, sensation, or any physical organ of vision, and you
prove an abnormal, supersensual, spiritual faculty—a proof
which puts an end to the theory of materialism, and which,
through its affinity with analogous or corresponding facts,
justifies its introduction as part of a scientific basis for the
spiritual theory.”</p>

<p>J. F. Deleuze was profoundly convinced of the existence
of this faculty. He claimed that the power of seeing at a
distance, prevision, and the transference of thought without
the aid of external signs, were in themselves sufficient proofs
of the existence of spirituality of soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p>Except in a very few instances, little or no pains are
taken to cultivate the spiritual nature of man. Civilised
man of to-day is but rising out of the age of brute force of
yesterday, and he is still circumscribed by love of earthly
power and position. He is an acquisitive rather than a
spiritual being. Being dominated by the senses, he will
naturally seek and appreciate that which gratifies his senses
most. He has little time or patience for anything which
does not contribute pleasure to his sensuous nature. He
would give time to the investigation of the soul side of life
if it brought gold, the means of enjoyment, and gratified his
acquisitiveness and love of power. Probably the majority
give the subject no attention at all. If the spiritual side of
our natures were as fully cultivated as those elements which
bring us bread and butter and praise of men in the market-place,
there is no doubt, no manner of doubt whatever, but
the most of us would occupy a nobler and more spiritually
elevated plane in life; and were adequate means taken, I
doubt not but this faculty of clairvoyance would become
more generally known and cultivated. Even to the selfish,
worldly and non-spiritual man, clairvoyance is not without
its practical side and utility, such, for instance, as supplying
Chicago with water. To the spiritually minded, clairvoyance
and all psychic gifts are appreciated, less for what they
will bring, than for the testimony they present of man’s
spiritual origin, transcendental powers and probable continuity
of life beyond this mortal vale.</p>

<span class="smcap">Clairvoyance Illustrated.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Clairvoyance</span> may be briefly classified as far and near,
direct and indirect, objective and subjective. I propose to
give a few well-authenticated cases to illustrate these phases
in this chapter.</p>


<h3>FAR AND DIRECT CLAIRVOYANCE</h3>

<p class="noindent">is possibly the highest and purest combination. The
sensitive is able to state facts not within the range of the
knowledge of those present. Thus when Swedenborg
described to the Queen and her friends, when at a distance
of several hundred miles from the conflagration, the burning
of her palace at Christiania, no one present could possibly
know of the fire or the incidents connected therewith.
Hence no thought-reading, brain-picking, much less guess-work
or coincidence, could account for the exactness of
details given by the seer. Clairvoyance in this case was not
only far and direct, but objective. That is, the matter
recorded was connected with the physical or objective plane.</p>


<h3>CLAIRVOYANCE AN AID TO SCIENCE.</h3>

<p>“Chicago, as is well-known, is one of the most go-ahead
cities in the world. Like Jonah’s gourd it appeared to spring
up in a night. Its population rapidly increased, and water
soon became a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine qua non</i>, both as regards use and luxury.
Science was at fault; for geologists had pronounced that
there could be no water beneath such a strata. Top water
was all that could be looked for, and presently a water
company was formed to supply this impure kind of
liquid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>“There happened to live at this time in Chicago a person
named Abraham James, a simple-minded man, of Quaker
descent, uneducated, and in fact, quite an ignorant person.
It was discovered by a Mrs. Caroline Jordon that James was
a natural clairvoyant, in fact a medium, and that he had
declared when put into the trance condition that both water
and petroleum, in large quantities, would be found in a
certain tract of land in the neighbourhood of the city. For
a long time no attention was paid to his statements. At
length two gentlemen from Maine, called Whitehead and
Scott, coming to Chicago on business, and hearing what had
been said by Abraham James, had him taken to the land
where he said water could be had in immense quantities by
boring for. Being entranced, James at once pointed out the
very spot. He told them that he not only saw the water,
but could trace its source from the Rocky Mountains, 2000
miles away, to the spot on which they stood, and could
sketch out on maps the strata and caverns through which it
ran. Negotiations were at once entered into for the purchase
of the land, and the work of boring was commenced. This
was in February, 1864, and the process went on daily till
November, when, having reached a depth of 711 feet, water
was struck, and flowed up at once at the rate of 600,000
gallons every 24 hours.</p>

<p>“The borings showed the following kinds of strata passed
through by the drill, and this was spiritually seen and
described by the clairvoyant as practical proofs to the senses
of other people. First the drill passed through alluvium
soil, 100 feet; limestone, saturated with oil, 35 feet, which
would burn as well as any coal; Joliet marble, 100 feet;
conglomerate strata of sand and flint, mixed with iron pyrites
and traces of copper, 125 feet; rock (shale) saturated with
petroleum, the sediment coming up like putty, thick and
greasy, 156 feet; galena limestone was next reached at a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
depth of 530 feet; a bed of limestone, containing flint and
sulphuret of iron was bored through, the depth being 639
feet, and being very hard, the work went on slowly. At
this point there appeared a constant commotion arising from
the escape of gas, the water suddenly falling from 30 to 60
feet, and then as suddenly rising to the surface, carrying with
it chippings from the drill, and other matters. The work
still went on; when at the depth of 711 feet the arch of the
rock was penetrated, and the water suddenly burst forth
from a bore 4½ in. at the bottom, of a temperature of 58° F.,
clear as crystal, pure as diamond, and perfectly free from
every kind of animal and vegetable matter, and which, for
drinking purposes and health, is much better adapted than
any water yet known, and will turn out to be the poor man’s
friend for all time to come.</p>

<p>“Here, then, is a huge fact for the faithless: the fact
brought to light by dynamic or invisible agency, and which
no power of negation can gainsay. Natural science said, No
water could be found; but psychology said—False, for I
will point out the spot where it will flow in splendid streams
as long as the earth spins on its axis. Since 1864 the
artesian well of Chicago has poured forth water at the rate
of a million and a half gallons daily; and what is economic,
to say nothing of Yankee shrewdness, it is conveyed into
ponds or reservoirs which in winter freeze, producing 40,000
tons of ice for sale, and which might be quadrupled at any
time.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> This is a case of far and near, direct and objective
clairvoyance. This historical incident proves the value and
reality of psychic vision.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>
<p>Indirect clairvoyance is the power of discerning what may
be more or less in the minds of those present, including
absent or forgotten thoughts and incidents. Thus, when a
clairvoyant describes a place with accuracy, recognised by
some one present to be correct, and also gives details partly
known and unknown, but afterwards found to be correct,
this mixture of phases may be recognised as indirect.</p>


<h3>SUBJECTIVE CLAIRVOYANCE</h3>

<p class="noindent">is that phase which enables the sensitive to perceive things
and ideas on the spiritual or subjective plane. The late
Rev. Stainton Moses, well known in literary circles as
“M.A., Oxon,” once asked the following pertinent
questions:—“Is there conceivably a mass of life all round
us of which most of us have no cognisance? One gifted
lady I know sees clairvoyantly the spirit-life of all organised
things, of a tree or plant for example. I have heard her
describe what her interior faculties perceive. Is it a fact
that spirit, underlying everything, can be so perceived
by the awakened faculties?” I should say yes. If this
lady’s clairvoyance has been of a high order in other
respects—why not in this? This type of psychic vision
is of the subjective order.</p>

<p>There are necessarily an infinite variety of phases, pure
and mixed, which the investigator will meet in practice.
These phases may be called <em>far</em>, such as seeing objects,
etc., at a distance—prevoyance, predicting events; retrovoyance,
reading the past; introvoyance, seeing internally,
or examining bodies, as in disease; external introvoyance,
seeing into lockets, packets, letters, safes, and discovering
hidden, known or forgotten, or lost objects. Lastly, there
is pseudo-clairvoyance. For one case of direct there are
hundreds of well authenticated cases of indirect clairvoyance,
and again for one of the latter there are thousands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
pseudo-clairvoyance, which are the outcome of states
similar to hypnosis, and are nothing more than an incongruous
medley of suggested ideas and fancies. Thus a
strong and positive willed person can impinge his ideas
through the thought-atmosphere of the sensitive and distort
or deflect the psychic vision, and render abortive any
attempts to get beyond the circle of the dominating
influence. Again, the sensitive may enter a realm of
fancy—a veritable dreamland of coherent and incoherent
ideation, either the product of the sensitive’s own condition,
or of suggestion—accidental, spontaneous, and determined—in
the sensitive’s surroundings. Of course any classification
of the numerous phases of clairvoyance must be purely
arbitrary.</p>


<h3>DIRECT AND OBJECTIVE CLAIRVOYANCE—LOST
GOODS RESTORED.</h3>

<p>This instance of far vision is taken from “A Tangled
Yarn,” page 173, “Leaves from Captain James Payn’s Log,”
which was published recently by C. H. Kelly. As I knew
Captain Hudson, of Swansea, personally, and heard from
his own lips the following incident, I have much pleasure in
introducing it here as a further illustration of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cui bono</i>
of clairvoyance:—</p>

<p>“The <i>Theodore</i> got into Liverpool the same day as the
<i>Bland</i>. She was a larger ship than ours but had a similar
cargo. The day that I went to the owners to report ‘all
right,’ I met with Captain Morton in a terrible stew because
he was thirty bales of cotton short, a loss equal to the
whole of his own wages and the mate’s into the bargain.
He was so fretted over it that his wife in desperation recommended
him to get the advice of a Captain Hudson, who
had a young female friend clever as a clairvoyant. We
were both sceptical in the matter of clairvoyance. At first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Morton didn’t wish to meddle, he said, with ‘a parcel of
modern witchcraft,’ and that sort of thing; but he at last
yielded to his wife’s urgency and consented to go. There
was first of all a half-crown fee to Captain Hudson, and
then the way was clear for an interview with the young
clairvoyant. I was present to ‘see fair.’ When the girl
had been put into the clairvoyant state Morton was instructed
to take her right hand in his right hand and
ask her any questions he wished. The replies were in
substance as follows:—She went back mentally to the port
whence the <i>Theodore</i> had sailed, retracing with her hand as
she in words also described the course of the ship from
Liverpool across the Atlantic, through the West Indian
group, etc., back to New Orleans. At length she said,
‘Yes, this is the place where the cotton was lost; it’s put
on board a big black ship with a red mark round it.’ Then
she began to trace with her hand and describe the homeward
course of the vessel, but after re-crossing the Atlantic,
instead of coming up the Irish Channel for Liverpool, she
turned along the English Channel as though bound for the
coast of France; and then stretching out her hand she
exclaimed, ‘Oh, here’s the cotton; but what funny people
they are; they don’t talk English.’ Captain Morton said
at once, ‘I see; it’s the <i>Brunswick</i>, Captain Thomas,’ an
American ship that lay alongside of him at New Orleans
and was taking in her cargo of cotton while the <i>Theodore</i>
was loading, and was bound for Havre de Grace. Captain
Morton, satisfied with his clairvoyant’s information, went
home and wrote immediately to Captain Thomas, inquiring
for his lost cargo. In due course he got an answer that the
cotton was certainly there, that it had been taken off the
wharf in mistake, and that it was about to be sold for whomsoever
it might concern; but that if he (Captain Morton)
would remit a certain amount to cover freight and expenses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the bales should be forwarded to him at once. He did so,
and in due time received the cotton, subject only to the
expenses of transit from Havre to Liverpool. Such are the
facts; I do not profess to offer any explanation.”</p>


<h3>CLAIRVOYANCE AN AID TO THE PHYSICIAN.</h3>

<p>I am indebted to Dr. George Wyld for this case, which
also exhibits the value of clairvoyance. Dr. Wyld had
the good fortune to make the acquaintance of a Mrs. D——,
a lady in private life who was endowed with the gift
of natural clairvoyance. Dr. Wyld told this lady of “a
friend who had for years suffered intense agony for hours
every night in his back and chest, and that latterly he
had been obliged to sit up all night in a chair, and his
legs began to swell.”</p>

<p>“This gentleman had regularly for three years been under
many of the leading physicians of London. Some said that
there must be some obscure heart affection, others said it
was neuralgia, one said it was gout, and the last consulted
said it was malignant caries of the spine.”</p>

<p>Dr. Wyld’s friend called upon him by appointment, and
met Mrs. D——. This lady merely looked at him. When
he had retired from the room Mrs. D—— made the
following statement of his case to the doctor:—“I have
seen what the disease is; I saw it as distinctly as if the
body were transparent. There is a tumour behind the
heart, about the size of a walnut; it is of a dirty colour;
and it jumps and looks as if it would burst. Nothing
can do him any good but entire rest.”</p>

<p>“I at once saw,” says Dr. Wyld, what she meant, and
sat down to write to my friend’s medical attendant as
follows:—</p>

<p>“I believe I have discovered the nature of Mr.——’s
disease. He has an aneurism on the descending aorta,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
about the size of a walnut. It is this which causes the
slight displacement which has been observed in the heart,
and the pressure of the tumour against the intercostal
nerves is the cause of the agony in the back, and the
peripheral pains in the front of the chest. You are going
to-morrow to see Sir —— in consultation; show him this
diagnosis, and let me know what he says.”</p>

<p>“Next the patient had the consultation, and Mrs. D——’s
diagnosis was confirmed; and the doctors agreed with
Mrs. D—— the only thing to be done was to take entire
rest. The treatment was duly followed up, with successful
results.” Dr. Wyld thoughtfully adds—“It is true that
the diagnosis cannot be absolutely confirmed during life,
but as the profession unanimously pronounce the disease
to be aneurism, the diagnosis may be accepted as correct.
This diagnosis has probably saved the gentleman’s
life, as before Mrs. D—— saw him he was allowed to
shoot over Scotch moors, and to ride, drive, and play
billiards.”</p>

<p>The use of clairvoyance in the diagnosis of disease is
by no means as rare as the majority of physicians and the
general public would naturally assume. I have had many
opportunities of witnessing the accuracy of diagnosis and
the excellence of the methods of treatment advised by
clairvoyants. In my own personal experience I have had
much evidence of correctness of clairvoyance in diagnosis,
and subsequent success in treatment. It is a phase most
desirable to cultivate if possible, and all allied conditions
connected therewith.</p>


<h3>TRAVELLING CLAIRVOYANCE.</h3>

<p>As a public entertainer at one time, giving demonstrations
of mesmeric phenomena, I have had naturally many
opportunities of seeing different types of clairvoyance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
During a course of entertainments given by me in Rothesay,
1881, I was able to introduce clairvoyance to public notice
by the most difficult method, that of public experiments.</p>

<p>M. C., the clairvoyante, was a native of Newcastle-on-Tyne.
All her clairvoyant experiments were satisfactory.
Her husband was also a clairvoyant, but not so striking
for public exhibition. M. C. seemed to possess all phases.
One or two experiments out of many will be interesting
not only as illustrative of clairvoyance, but because what
I relate can be easily ratified.</p>

<p>M. C. arrived in Rothesay for the first time about four
hours previously to taking her seat upon the platform,
in the New Public Halls. It was neither possible nor
probable she could have obtained the information she
possessed by other than psychic means. The clairvoyant
was mesmerised and blindfolded before the audience.
After some experiments in objective clairvoyance were
given, such as describing a watch, telling the time, and
the number, by having the watch held silently over her
forehead, she gave several experiments in travelling clairvoyance.
Many visitors in the hall—for Rothesay is a well
known and fashionable seaside resort—sent up requests
to the platform, and desired the clairvoyante should visit
their homes in Kent, Cornwall, Island of Jersey, in the Isle
of Man, Glasgow, and other places. Her visits and descriptions
were in all instances extremely satisfactory. How far
thought-transference and objective clairvoyance commingled
and entered into her descriptions it would be difficult to
say, but the results were simply marvellous.</p>

<p>Test case, by the late Dr. Maddever, M.D., M.R.C.S.,
and Dr. John Maddever, his son. These medical gentlemen
resided in Rothesay, and were present in the hall. Dr.
Maddever desired me to send the clairvoyante into a certain
room in his house and that she should describe it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p>All the directions the clairvoyante obtained were, “to go
out of the hall, down the front steps; when out turn to the
right and proceed onward till she came to an iron-railed
gate, on which was a small brass plate, bearing the name of
‘Dr. Maddever,’ she was to open the gate, go up to the hall-door,
enter, pass the first door to the left, and turn round a
passage to the left and enter the first <a id="door"></a><ins title="Original has 'doo'">door</ins> to which she
came, and describe what she saw.”</p>

<p>Sitting still upon the platform in silence for a minute or
two, she suddenly exclaimed:—“I am at the gate—at the
door—now in the hall—I have found the room, and I am now
inside, and stand with my back to the door.” She then
proceeded to describe the room, the book-cases which surrounded
it, their peculiar structure; the mantel-piece, the form
of the clock, the time, and the appearance of the ornaments.
The table in the centre of the room, its form, the colour and
style of the cloth upon it, books, albums, and papers thereon,
the flower vase support in the window, and a number of
other particulars.</p>

<p>At the conclusion Dr. Maddever arose in the audience
and said:—“Ladies and gentlemen, Professor Coates is a
stranger to me, I only know of him by report. The young
lady on the platform I do not know. I have not seen either
till this evening, and they have never been in my house.
The experiment we have had is most remarkable, and should
be of deep and profound interest to all. The young lady
has described the room, as far as I can remember, most
correctly—in fact very much better than I could have done
myself.” This statement was received with applause.</p>

<p>After one or two instances of travelling clairvoyance, a
young gentleman rose in the body of the hall and desired I
should send the sensitive to a house or villa not far from the
juncture of Marine Place and Ardbeg Road.</p>

<p>The directions given to the clairvoyante were briefly to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
effect, she was to leave the place, on reaching the front
street she was to turn to her left and keep on past the Post
Office, Esplanade, past the Skeoch Woods, etc., till she came
to the house. She nodded her head in compliance, and
presently announced she “had found the house.” Then she
shivered and appeared to draw back, and said “I won’t
go in.”</p>

<p>Some persons in the audience laughed, and one (I think it
was the young gentleman who asked that she might be sent)
said: “The whole thing is a swindle.” Now, considering
there was not a single flaw in the experiments that night,
surprise after surprise being given, and the audience had
risen in enthusiasm, this opinion was not favourably received.</p>

<p>I asked the gentleman “to have patience.” I had no
doubt but we would know soon enough the reasons.
“Whatever they were I would try and ascertain them.”</p>

<p>With much hesitancy she declared that “the house was not
one any respectable female would enter, and she would not.”
When I repeated this statement to the audience, there was
what the newspapers call “sensation.” The sensation was
intensified when one of the Rothesay Magistrates, Bailie
Molloy, the then senior Bailie of the Royal Burgh, declared
“the young woman was right, perfectly right, this was a
house which had been inadvertently let to persons of ill-fame,
and he, for one, had recently had the facts of the
case placed before him, and he was most anxious that these
people should be put out, and they would be, as soon as the
proper steps could be taken.”</p>

<p>The young gentleman retired somewhat discomfited, and
the excitement produced by these and other experiments
brought crowded houses during my professional stay.</p>

<p>When my “mesmeric exposition” was concluded, the
two medical gentlemen referred to, were good enough to
introduce themselves, and invited me to call next day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
to see the room. I accepted the invitation during the
following day and saw how truly correct and vivid her
description had been. In the first experiment the sensitive
described the state of the doctor’s library, pointing out
what had not been recollected by either of the medical
men, and I believe the other case comes under the heading
of direct and objective clairvoyance. Dr. Maddever’s house
was about a quarter of a mile, and the other house about a
mile and a half from the hall.</p>

<p>The persistent and reliable clairvoyance evinced by this
sensitive was induced. She was a mesmeric subject, and
when such subjects are properly treated they make the
very best clairvoyants.</p>


<h3>PSYCHIC VISION POSSESSED BY THE PHYSICALLY
BLIND.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Croad resided at Redland, Bristol. My attention
was called to her case about fifteen years ago by Dr. J. G.
Davey, of Bristol. Unfortunately circumstances at the time
prevented a personal visit and report. Her psychic gifts
and wonderful supersensitivity have been amply testified to,
by most reliable witnesses, such as Dr. Davey, Hy. G.
Atkinson, F.G.S., and others.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance in Mrs. Croad’s case was and is (for I believe
the lady is still living) a singular admixture of subtle sense
transference so well known to mesmerists of the old school,
and spontaneous psychic vision. Thought-transference and
indirect clairvoyance, more or less induced, by intense
voluntary concentration.</p>

<p>Mrs. Croad is deaf, dumb, and paralysed, and stone blind.
She can see and hear, read with powers “denied to ordinary
mortals,” and discern pictures and writings in the dark. She
is aware of her daughter’s thoughts when the latter touches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
her, and becomes at once acquainted with what her daughter
wishes to communicate. She possesses supersensitivity of
touch, and discerns colour by their degrees of heat, roughness
or smoothness. She can also <a id="identify"></a><ins title="Original has 'indentify'">identify</ins> photographs
and pictures in the same way. From time to time she has
exhibited the highest phases of clairvoyance. Reports have
been made in this case by medical experts in the <cite>Journal
of Psychological Medicine</cite>, and other magazines and journals
several years ago. The most recent was contributed by
the Rev. Taliesin Dans, The Cottage, Claptons, to <cite>The
Review of Reviews</cite> in January, 1891.</p>


<h3>THE SPIRITUALISTIC AND PRACTICAL CHARACTER OF
CLAIRVOYANCE</h3>

<p class="noindent">might be further illustrated by the well known case of
Miss Eliza Hamilton, who became paralysed in her limbs
and right arm, through severe injury to the spine. She had
been in hospital for four months, on her return home
frequently passed into the trance state, and on awakening
described various people and places she had visited, and objects
seen. These descriptions have been invariably verified
subsequently. “She also at times,” says her physician,
“speaks of having been in the company of persons with
whom she was acquainted in this world, but who have
passed away; and she tells her friends that they have
become more beautiful, and have cut off their infirmities
with which they were afflicted while here. She often
describes events which <em>are about to happen</em>, and these are
always fulfilled exactly as she predicts.”</p>

<p>“Her father,” says Mr. Hudson Tuttle, “read in her
presence a letter he had received from a friend in Leeds,
speaking of the loss of his daughter, about whose fate he
was very unhappy, as she had disappeared nearly a month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
before, and left no trace. Eliza went into the trance state,
and cried out, ‘Rejoice! I have found the lost girl! She
is happy in the angel world.’ She said the girl had fallen
into the dark water where dyers washed their cloths;
that her friends could not have found her had they sought
her there, <em>but</em> now the body had floated a few miles, and
would be found in the River Aire. The body was found as
described.</p>

<p>“Now, knowing that her eyes were closed, that she
could not hear, that her bodily senses were in profound
lethargy, how are we to account for the intensity and
keenness of sight? Her mental powers were exceedingly
exalted, and scarcely a question could be asked her but she
correctly answered.</p>

<p>“In this case the independence of the mind of the
physical body are shown in every instance of clairvoyance,
is proven beyond cavil or doubt. If it is demonstrated
that the mind sees without the aid of eyes, hears when the
ears are deaf, feels when the nerves of sensation are at rest,
it follows that it is independent of these outward avenues,
and has other channels of communication with the external
world essentially its own.”</p>


<h3>CLAIRVOYANCE FROM DISEASE.</h3>

<p>Miss Mollie Fancher, of Brooklyn Heights, fell off a
tramway car when eighteen years of age, experienced very
severe injuries to head and spine, her body being dragged
a distance, through her dress catching on the step of the
car. She became paralysed, lost all her senses, except
touch. She gradually recovered hearing, taste, and ability
to talk in time. She was also blind for nine years. Drs.
Speir and Ormiston were her physicians, men of skill and
marked probity. These, with a veritable host of medical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
men—ministers of the Gospel, educationists and specialists—have
borne testimony to her remarkable endowments, from
which we take two extracts. Mr. Charles Ewart, Principal
of the Brooklyn Heights Seminary, where she was under
special care, writes:—</p>

<p>“For many days together she has been to all appearances
dead. The slightest pulse could not be detected;
there was no evidence of respiration. Her limbs were as
cold as ice, and had there not been some warmth about
her heart, she would have been buried. When I first saw
her she had but one sense—that of touch. By running
her fingers over the printed page, she could read with
equal facility in light or darkness. The most delicate work
is done by her in the night.... Her power of
clairvoyance, or second sight, is marvellously developed.
<em>Distance imposes no barriers</em>, without the slightest error
she dictates the contents of sealed letters which have
never been in her hands. She discriminates in darkness
the most delicate shades of colour. She writes with
extraordinary rapidity.”</p>

<p>Mr. Henry M. Parkhurst, the astronomer (residing at
173 Gates Avenue, Brooklyn, N.Y.), writes:—</p>

<p>“From the waste-basket of a New York gentleman
acquaintance he fished an unimportant business letter,
without reading it, tore it into ribbons, and tore the
ribbons into squares. He shook the pieces well together,
put them into an envelope, and sealed it. This he
subsequently handed to Miss Fancher. The blind girl
took the envelope in her hand, and passed her hand over
it several times, called for paper and pencil, and wrote it
verbatim. The seal of the letter had not been broken.
Mr. Parkhurst himself opened it, pasted the contents
together, and compared the two. Miss Fancher’s was
a literal copy of the original.”</p>

<h3>MESMERIC CLAIRVOYANCE AND SPIRITUALISM.</h3>

<p>“A few evenings ago I called upon Mr. and Mrs.
Loomis, 2 Vernon Place, Bloomsbury, and after we had
chatted for a short time in the drawing-room with the
door closed and nobody else present, I asked if they would
try a mesmeric experiment for me. They willingly agreed,
and Mr. Loomis, by passes, threw his wife into a mesmeric
state, as he often does, and an intelligence, which claimed
to be the spirit of her mother, spoke through her lips.
Until this moment I had said nothing to any living soul about
the nature of my contemplated experiment, but I then asked
the unseen intelligence if it could then and there go to the
house of Mrs. Macdougall Gregory, 21 Green Street,
Grosvenor Square, London, and move a heavy physical
object in her presence. The reply was, I do not know, I
will try. About three minutes afterwards, at 8.40 p.m., the
intelligence said that Mrs. Gregory was in her drawing-room
with a friend, and added, ‘I have made Mrs. Gregory feel
a prickly sensation in her arm from the elbow down to the
hand, as if some person had squeezed the arm, and she has
spoken about it to her friend.’</p>

<p>“I took a note in writing of this statement at the time it
was made. A few minutes later I left Mr. and Mrs. Loomis,
and without telling them my intention to do so, went straight
to the house of Mrs. Gregory about a mile and a half off.
I had selected Mrs. Gregory for this experiment because
she is not afraid to publish her name in connection with
psychic truths, and her word carries weight, especially in
Scotland, where she and her family are well-known. She is
the widow of Professor Gregory, of Edinburgh University,
and is a lineal descendant of the Lord of the Isles. I then
for the first time told Mrs. Gregory of the experiment. She
replied that between half-past eight and nine o’clock that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
evening she was playing the piano, and suddenly turned
round to her friend, Miss Yauewicz, of Upper Norwood,
saying, ‘I don’t know what is the matter with me, I feel
quite stupid, and have such a pain in my right arm that I
cannot go on playing.’ Miss Yauewicz, who was no
believer in spiritualism or any of the marvels of psychology,
felt a lively interest when she was informed of the experiment.
She told me that she clearly remembered Mrs.
Gregory’s statement that she could not go on playing
because of the pain in her right arm.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>Mrs. Loomis was a remarkable clairvoyante, whom I
accidently became acquainted with in Liverpool many years
ago, shortly after her arrival from America. I introduced the
lady and her husband, Mr. Daniel Loomis, to Mr. Harrison,
then editor of <cite>The Spiritualist</cite>. The Guion steamer, <i>Idaho</i>,
in which they came from New York, was wrecked off the
Irish Coast, and all they possessed in this world was lost
with the vessel. Mrs. Loomis predicted the disaster, where
it was likely to take place; that all hands would be saved,
but all they had lost. Upon the arrival of the officers of
the vessel in Liverpool, they presented Mrs. Loomis, at the
Bee Hotel, John Street, Liverpool, with a basket of flowers,
purse, and testimonial, in recognition of her gift, and heroic
conduct during and after the disaster. I may add I knew
Mr. Harrison as a most careful investigator and a man of
scientific tastes and ability.</p>

<p>I select the following case of a mesmeric sensitive controlled
by a disembodied spirit, from the writings of Mr.
Epes Sargent, author of “Planchette on the Despair of
Science,” etc., as appropriately illustrative of this form
of clairvoyance:—</p>

<p>“One of the daughters of my valued correspondent, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
late William Howett, was a mesmeric sensitive. Howett
told Professor W. D. Gunning, whose words (slightly
abridged) I here use, that, on one occasion his daughter,
being entranced, wrote a communication signed with the
name of her brother, supposed to be in Australia. The
import was, that he had been drowned a few days before
in a lake. Dates and details were given. The parents
could only wait, as there was no trans-oceanic telegraph.
Months passed, and at last a letter came from a nephew in
Melbourne, bearing the tidings that their son had been
drowned on such a day, in such a lake, under such and
such circumstances. Date, place, and all the essential
details were the same as those given months before through
the daughter. Mr. Howett believed that the freed spirit
of his son influenced the sister to write; and I know of no
explanation more rational that this.”</p>


<h3>CLAIRVOYANCE DUE TO SPIRITUAL CONTROL.</h3>

<p>Such cases as the above are the most difficult of all to prove.
What I contend for is, if it is demonstrated we can control a
fellow-being, throw him or her into a trance state—in which the
phenomena of the psychic state are evolved—and seeing such
state is induced largely by the control of spirit over spirit in
the body, why may not a disembodied spirit control, direct,
or influence a suitable sensitive or medium in the body? If
not, why not? There is abundant evidence of such controls.</p>

<p>Seeing objects concealed in boxes and letters, or reading
books and mottoes, etc., appears to some clairvoyants to be
more difficult than diagnosing disease, or seeing objects at
a distance. The why and wherefore seems at first difficult
to explain.</p>

<p>The deliberate concealment of objects for the purpose of
testing clairvoyance is often the result of a spirit of virulent
suspicion, disbelief, and what is worse, <em>an earnest desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
for failure</em>, so that the parties may rejoice on the discomfiture
of the clairvoyants. With such people failure is a
source of pleasure. Nevertheless, seeming impossibilities
have been triumphed over. Long lost wills have been
found, and places of the accidental or intentional hiding
discovered. In more than one case deliberate fraud has
been exposed, and the guilty parties brought to acknowledge
the truth of the sensitive’s revelations.</p>


<h3>THE FUGITIVE NATURE OF CLAIRVOYANCE.</h3>

<p>“The chief feature,” said Alexis Didier, “of the somnambulistic
lucidity is its variability. While the conjurer or
juggler, at all moments in the day and before all spectators,
will invariably succeed, the somnambulist, endowed with
the marvellous power of clairvoyance, will not be lucid
with all interviewers and at all moments of the day; for
the faculty of lucidity being a crisis painful and abnormal,
there may be atmospheric influences or invincible antipathies
at work opposing its production, and which seem to
paralyse all supersensual manifestation. Intuition, clairvoyance,
lucidity, are faculties which the somnambulist
gets from the nature of his temperament, and which are
rarely developed in force.” Further, he adds, “the
somnambulistic lucidity varies in a way to make one
despair; success is continually followed by failure; in
a word, error succeeds a truth; but when one analyses
the causes of this no right-minded person will bring up
the charge of Charlatanism, since the faculty is subject to
influences independent of the will and the consciousness
of the clairvoyant.”</p>

<p>Alexis Didier, like his brother Adolphe, was a natural
clairvoyant, and excelled in direct and objective clairvoyance,
phases of the most striking and convincing character.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance can be cultivated by the aid of mesmerism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and by the introspection process. By the first, the sensitive
can be materially assisted by the experience and help of
the operator. By the second, something like natural
clairvoyance can be induced. Either processes are more
or less suitable to subdue the activity of the senses, and
give greater range to the psychic powers. General instructions
are of little use. Personal advice is best. The
operator then knows with whom he has to do, their special
temperament and character, what are the best processes to
adopt to cultivate their gift, and how far such sensitives and
students are themselves likely to be suitable for clairvoyant
experiments. I have found the “Mirror Disc” useful in
inducing favourable conditions in the normal state for the
development of clairvoyance, and recommend its use.</p>

<p class="pfs90">J. RHODES BUCHANAN, M.D.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">What</span> is psychometry? Dr. George Wyld esteems
psychometry a phase of clairvoyance—“the knowledge the
psychic obtains by a <em>clue</em>, such as a lock of the hair of
some absent person, or some portion of a distant object.”
Mr. Stead calls it (<cite>Review of Reviews</cite>, p. 221, September,
1892) “the strange new science of psychometry.” In
this he pardonably errs. Psychometry may be strange,
but <em>it</em> is <em>not</em> new. We may not recognise the name as old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
but the class of phenomena it specialises is as old as clairvoyance
and mind-reading.</p>

<p>“The word psychometry,” says Dr. Buchanan, “coined
in 1842, to express the character of a new science and
art, is the most pregnant and important word that has
been added to the English language. Coined from the
Greek (<i>psyche</i>, soul; and <i>metron</i>, measure), it literally
signifies <em>soul-measuring</em>.”... “The psychometer
measures the soul.”</p>

<p>In the case of psychometry, the measuring assumes a
new character, as the object measured and the measuring
instrument are the same psychic element, and its measuring
power is not limited to the psychic, as it was developed
in the first experiments, but has appeared by successive
investigations to manifest a wider and wider area of power,
until it became apparent that this psychic capacity was
really the measure of all things in the universe. Hence,
psychometry signifies not merely the measuring of souls
and soul capacities, or qualities by our own psychic
capacities, but the measurement and judgment of all things
conceivable by the human mind; and psychometry means
practically <em>measuring by the soul</em>, or grasping and estimating
all things which are within the range of human intelligence.
Psychometry, therefore, is not merely an instrumentality
for measuring soul powers, but a comprehensive agency
like mathematics for the solution of many departments of
science.</p>

<p>“Prophecy,” says Buchanan, “is the noblest aspect
of psychometry, and there is no reason why it <a id="should"></a><ins title="Original has 'hould'">should</ins> not
become the guiding power to each individual life, and the
guiding power of the destiny of nations.” For instance,
while all Europe feared for Boulanger, Metz was getting
stored with food; Lord Wolseley declared war imminent,
and the French themselves prepared for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">revanche</i>. Psychometers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
declared for peace in 1889, and said there was
no prospect of war for five years. Subsequent events have
proved Boulanger lacking in both generalship and statesmanship—a
veritable Bombastes Furioso; and peace up to
the time of writing is as yet unbroken.</p>

<p>Dr. Buchanan claims—“In physiology, pathology, and
hygiene, psychometry is as wise and parental as in matters
of character and ethics. A competent psychometer
appreciates the vital forces, the temperament, the
peculiarities, and every departure from the normal state,
realising the diseased condition with an accuracy in which
external diagnosis often fails. In fact, the natural
psychometer is born with a genius for the healing art,
and if the practice of medicine were limited to those who
possess this power in an eminent degree, its progress
would be rapid, and its disgraceful failures in diagnosis
and blunders in treatment and prognosis would be less
frequently heard of.” Many happy tests in diagnosis and
in the successful treatment of disease—out of the ordinary
routine—are due, in my opinion, not so much to elaborate
medical training as to the fact of the practitioner—perhaps
unconscious to himself—being possessed of more or less of
the psychometric faculty.</p>

<p>Dr. Buchanan,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> in his “Original Sketch,” gives us the
history and some details of his discovery, based upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
certain investigations of the nervous system. Already he
was well versed in the phenomena of hypnotism, which is
at this late day becoming a fashionable study and recreation
of medical men. He had demonstrated the responsive action
of cerebral organs to mesmeric touch and influence, and
he was already acquainted with the curious psychological
phenomena of sense and thought transference, of double
consciousness, and all the nervous and pathological phases
peculiar to natural and artificial somnambulism. His
investigation for years of the nervous system had clearly
shown him that its capacities were far more extensive,
varied, and interesting than physiologists and philosophers
either knew or were prepared to admit. He found in the
nervous system a vast aggregate of powers which constitute
the vitality of man, existing in intimate connection with
the vast and wonderful powers of his mind. Was it
possible or rational to suppose that this nerve-matter, so
intimately co-related with mind, and upon which the mind
depends for the manifestation of its powers, could be
entirely limited to the narrow materialistic sphere assigned
by physiologists? He thought not.</p>

<p>In a conversation with Bishop Polk (who afterwards
became the celebrated General Polk of Confederate fame),
Dr. Buchanan ascertained that Bishop Polk’s nervous sensibility
was so acute that, if by accident he touched a piece
of brass in the night, when he could not see what he
had touched, he immediately felt the influence through
his system, and recognised an offensive metallic taste.</p>

<p>The discovery of such sensitiveness in one of the most
vigorous men, in mind and body, of his day, led Dr.
Buchanan to believe it might be found in many others.
It is needless to say his conjecture was correct.
Accordingly, in the numerous neurological experiments
which he afterwards commenced, he was accustomed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
place metals of different kinds in the hands of persons
of acute sensibility, for the purpose of ascertaining whether
they could feel any peculiar influence, recognise any
peculiar taste, or appreciate the difference of metals, by
any impression upon their own sensitive nerves. It
soon appeared that the power was quite common, and
there were a large number of persons who could determine
by touching a piece of metal, or by holding it in their
hands, what the metal was, as they recognised a peculiar
influence proceeding from it, which in a few moments
gave them a distinct taste in the mouth. But this
sensitiveness was not confined to metallic substances.
Every substance possessing a decided taste—sugar, salt,
nutmeg, pepper, acid, etc.—appeared to be capable of
transferring its influence. The influence appeared to
affect the hand, and then travel upwards. He afterwards
demonstrated when a galvanic or electric current passed
through a medicinal substance, the influence of the substance
was transmitted with the current, detected and
described by the person operated upon. Medicinal substances,
enclosed in paper, were readily recognised and
described by their effects. In due time, stranger still, a
geological specimen, an article worn, a letter written upon,
a photograph which had been handled, a coin, etc., transmitted
their influence, and the psychometrist was enabled
to read off the history concerning the particular object.</p>

<p>Nearly fifty years have elapsed since the discovery of
this “strange new science” and art. “To-day it is widely
known, has its respected and competent practitioners, who
are able to describe the mental and vital peculiarities of
those who visit or write them, and who create astonishment
and delight by the fidelity and fulness of the descriptions
which they send to persons unknown, and at vast distances.
They give minute analysis of character and revelations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
of particulars <em>known only to the one described</em>, pointing
out with parental delicacy and tenderness the defects
which need correction, or in the perverse and depraved
they explain what egotism would deny, but what society,
family, and friends recognise to be too true.”</p>


<h3>PSYCHOMETRIC REFLECTIONS.</h3>

<p>Professor J. W. Draper says:—“A shadow never falls
upon a wall without leaving thereupon a permanent trace—a
trace made visible by resorting to proper processes.
Upon the walls of private apartments, where we think
the eye of intrusion is altogether shut out, and our
retirement can never be profaned, there exists the vestiges
of our acts, silhouettes of whatever we have done. It
is a crushing thought to whoever has committed secret
crime, that the picture of his deed, and the very echo
of his words, may be seen and heard countless years
after he has gone the way of all flesh, and left a
reputation for ‘respectability’ to his children.”</p>

<p>Detectives have received impressions from a scene of
crime, a clue to the unravelment of the mystery and the
detection of the criminal. Yet they could not trace the
impressions to anything they saw or heard during their
preliminary investigations. No detective will throw aside
such impressions. Indeed, those most successful are those
who, while paying attention to all outward and so-called
tangible clues, <em>do not neglect for one moment</em> the impressions
received, and the thoughts <em>felt</em>, when gathering information
likely to lead to the detection of the law-breakers. Hugh
Miller was right when he said, “I suspect that there are
provinces in the mind that physicians have not entered
into.”</p>

<p>Thoughts are things—living, real and tangible, images,
visions, deep and pungent sensations—which exist after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
their creation distinct and apart from ourselves—“Footprints
on the sands of time,” in more senses than one.
We all leave our mark in a thousand subtle ways. No
material microscope or telescope can detect, nevertheless
our mark can be discovered by the powers of the human
soul. From our cradle to the grave—does it stop there?—every
thought, emotion, movement, and action have left
their subtle traces, so that our whole life can be traced
out by the psychometric expert. We verily give hostages
to fortune all through life.</p>


<h3>PSYCHOMETRIC SENSITIVES.</h3>

<p>Professor Denton was very fortunate in having in his
wife, children, and in his sister, Mrs. Cridge, gifted
psychometers. His sister possessed this psychic, intuitive
faculty in a high degree. Dr. Buchanan was equally
fortunate; not only was his wife a first-class sensitive,
but he discovered the faculty in several university professors,
and in students innumerable. Denton in his travels over
America, Europe, and Australia found several hundred
good sensitives, some of whom have since made a reputation
both in Europe and America for their powers.</p>

<p>One important fact we learn from these pioneers in
psychometric research is that not one of these persons
knew they were endowed with the psychometric gift prior
to taking part in classes or experiments.</p>

<p>The possession of the faculty is not confined to any age,
or to the gentle sex; and Denton concludes, as an average,
that one female in four and one man in ten are psychometric
sensitives. The possibility is all healthy, sensitive, refined,
intuitive, and impressionable persons possess the soul-measuring
faculty, and this faculty, like all other innate
human powers, can be cultivated and brought to a high
stage of perfection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>The psychometer, unlike the induced clairvoyant or
entranced medium, is in general, or outwardly at least,
a mere spectator, as one who beholds a drama or witnesses
a panorama, and tells in his own way to someone else
what he sees and what he thinks about it. The sensitive
can dwell on what is seen, examine it closely, and record
individual opinions of the impressions of the persons,
incidents, and scenes of the long hidden thus brought to
light. The sensitive has merely to hold the object in
hand—as Mrs. Coates is represented doing in <a href="#frontis">frontispiece</a>—or
hold it to the forehead (temple), when he or she is
enabled to come in contact with the soul of the person
or thing with which the object has been in relation. There
is no loss of external consciousness, no “up rush” of
the subliminal, obliterating and overlapping that of
common life. The sensitive appears to be in a perfectly
normal condition during the whole time of examination,
can lay the article down, noticing what takes place, and
entering into conversation with those in the room, or
drawing subjects, seen or not, as they think best.</p>


<h3>WHAT PSYCHOMETRY CAN DO.</h3>

<p>We can do little more than give a few general illustrations.
Professor Denton, having thoroughly satisfied himself of the
reality of psychometry, wondered if letters had photographed
upon them the impressions of the life and the image of the
writer. Why not fossils? “He gave his sister a specimen
from the carboniferous formation; closing her eyes, she
described those swamps and trees, with their tufted heads
and scaly trunks, with the great frog-like animals that existed
in that age. To his inexpressible delight the key to the ages
was in his hands. He concluded that nature had been
photographing from the very first. The black islands that
floated upon the fiery sea, the gelatinous dots, the first life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
on our planet, up through everything that flew or swam, had
been photographed by Nature, and ten thousand experiments
had confirmed the theory. He got a specimen of the lava
that flowed from Kilava, in Hawaii, in 1848. His sister by
its means described the boiling ocean, the cataract of molten
lava that almost equalled Niagara in size. A small fragment
of a meteorite that fell in Painesville, O., was given to
his wife’s mother, a sensitive who did not then believe in
psychometry. This is what she said: ‘I seem to be travelling
away, away, through nothing, right forward. I see
what look like stars and mist. I seem to be taken right up;
the other specimens took me down.’ His wife, independently,
gave a similar description, but saw it revolving, and
its tail of sparks. He took steps to prove that this was not
mind reading by wrapping the specimens in paper, shaking
them up in a hat, and allowing the sensitive to pick out one
and describe it, without anyone knowing which it was.
Among them were a fragment of brick from ancient Rome,
antimony from Borneo, silver from Mexico, basalt from
Fingal’s Cave. Each place was described correctly by the
sensitive in the most minute detail. A fragment from the
Mount of Olives brought a description of Jerusalem; and
one from the Great Pyramid enabled a young man of
Melbourne to name and describe it. There was a practical
side to the question. His wife had, from a chip of wood,
described a suicide; this was subsequently confirmed. A
number of experiments from a fragment of Kent’s Cave,
fragments from Pompeii and other places brought minute
descriptions from the sensitive.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stead bears his testimony to psychometry. He gave
a shilling to two ladies, at different periods, and unknown to
each other. In fact, they were perfect strangers. This
shilling, in his mind, had a special story connected with it.
The first lady lived in Wimbledon, and had the profession<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
of being a clairvoyante. To use Mr. Stead’s own words, he
states:—“I took from my purse a shilling which I most
prized of all the pieces of money in my possession. I said
nothing to her beyond that I had carried it in my pocket for
several years. She held the shilling in her hand for sometime,
and said:—‘This carries me back to a time of confusion
and much anxiety, with a feeling that everything depended
upon a successful result. This shilling brings me a vision
of a very low woman, ignorant and drunken, with whom you
had much better have nothing to do. There is a great deal
of fever about. I feel great pains, as if I had rheumatic
fever in my ankles and joints, but especially in my ankles
and my throat. I suffer horribly in my throat; it is an
awful pain. And now I feel a coarse, bare hand pass over
my brow as distinctly as if you had laid your hand there. It
must be her hand. I feel the loss of a child. This woman is
brought to me by another. She is about thirty-two years;
about five feet high, with dark brown hair, grey eyes, small,
nicely-formed nose, large mouth.’” “Can you tell me her
name?” asked Mr. Stead. “Not certain, but I think it
seems like Annie.” “That is all right,” said Mr. Stead,
and he told her the story of that shilling. About a month
afterwards, Mr. Stead tried a Swedish opera singer, who had
clairvoyant powers, with the shilling. She pressed it to her
brow, and then she told Mr. Stead “she saw a poor woman
give him, from her pocket-money, the last shilling she
possessed. She has a great admiration for you, she said.
She seems to think you have saved her, but she is not <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une
grande dame</i>. Indeed, she seems to be a girl of the town.”
Mr. Stead said:—“I had not spoken a word, or given her
the least hint of the story of the shilling.” Now, what are
the facts? Mr. Stead says that he “was standing his trial
at the Old Bailey, a poor outcast girl of the streets, who was
dying of a loathsome disease in the hospital, asked that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
only shilling that she possessed in the world, might be given
to the fund which was being raised in his defence. It was
handed to him when he came out of jail, with, ‘From a dying
girl in hospital, who gives her last shilling,’ written on the
paper.” He (Mr. Stead) has carried it about him ever since,
never allowing it to be out of his possession for a single day.</p>

<p>The symptoms which the first clairvoyante, or psychometrix,
described, were very like those which this poor
creature was suffering from in her dying hours. It is too
probable that the donor was a low, drunken woman.</p>

<p>These two readings are actually more psychometric than
clairvoyant, because, from the clue furnished, they went
back and described the conditions and surroundings of the
woman who parted with this shilling. They were not
thought-readers, because they did not describe what was
passing in Mr. Stead’s mind. Mr. Stead’s experiences fairly
illustrate the exercise, in the earlier stages of employment, of
the psychometric faculty.</p>

<p>While engaged writing the “Real Ghost Stories,” Mr.
Stead says:—“My attention was called to a young lady,
Miss Catherine Ross, of 41 High Street, Smethwick,
Birmingham, who, being left with an invalid sister to
provide for, and without other available profession or
industry, bethought herself of a curious gift of reading
character, with which she seems to have been born, and had
subsequently succeeded in earning a more or less precarious
income by writing out characters at the modest fee of 5s.
You sent her any article you pleased that had been in contact
with the object, and she sent you by return a written
analysis of the subject’s character. I sent her various articles
from one person at different times, not telling her they were
from the same person. At one time a tuft of hair from his
beard, at another time a fragment of a nail, and a third time
a scrap of handwriting. Each delineation of character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
differed in some points from the other two, but all agreed,
and they were all remarkably correct. When she sent the
last she added, ‘I don’t know how it is, but I feel I have
described this person before.’ I have tried her since then
with locks of hair from persons of the most varied disposition,
and have found her wonderfully correct.”</p>

<p>“All these things are very wonderful, but the cumulative
value of the evidence is too great for any one to
pooh-pooh it as antecedently impossible. The chances
against it being a mere coincidence are many millions to
one.”</p>

<p>I believe had this young lady, or others thus endowed, had
the training, such as Buchanan, Denton, or other experienced
teachers give their pupils, she would make a high
class psychometer.</p>

<p>Rev. Minot J. Savage had a paper in a recent number of
<cite>The Arena</cite>, on Psychical Research, etc., in which he said—“On
a certain morning I visited a psychometrist. Several
experiments were made. I will relate only one, as a good
specimen of what has occurred in my presence more than
once. The lady was not entranced or, so far as I could see,
in any other than her normal condition. I handed her a
letter which I had recently received. She took it, and held
it in her right hand, pressing it close, so as to come into as
vital contact with it as possible. I had taken it out of its
envelope, so that she might touch it more effectively, but it
was not unfolded even so much as to give her an opportunity
to see even the name. It was written by a man whom she
had never seen, and of whom she had never heard. After
holding it a moment she said, ‘This man is either a minister
or a lawyer; I cannot tell which. He is a man of a good
deal more than usual intellectual power. And yet he has
never met with any success in life as one would have
expected, considering his natural ability. Something has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
happened to thwart him and interfere with his success. At
the present time he is suffering with severe illness and
mental depression. He has pain here’ (putting her hand to
the back of her head, at the base of the brain).</p>

<p>“She said much more, describing the man as well as I
could have done it myself. But I will quote no more, for
I wish to let a few salient points stand in clear outline.
These points I will number, for the sake of clearness:—</p>

<p>1. “She tells me he is a man, though she has not even
glanced at the letter.”</p>

<p>2. “She says he is either a minister or a lawyer; she
cannot tell which. No wonder, for he was both; that is,
he had preached for some years, then he had left the pulpit,
studied law, and at this time was not actively engaged in
either profession.”</p>

<p>3. “She speaks of his great natural ability. This was
true in a most marked degree.”</p>

<p>4. “But he had not succeeded as one would have expected.
This again was strikingly true. Certain things had happened—which
I do not feel at liberty to publish—which
had broken off his career in the middle and made his short
life seem abortive.”</p>

<p>About eighteen years ago a lady in Swansea sent me a lock
of hair, and asked me to send her my impressions. I did so,
which I remember were not pleasant. I informed her, as near
as my recollection now serves, that the person to whom the
hair belonged was seriously ill. No earthly skill could do
anything for him. Diagnosing the character of the insidious
disease which was then undermining a once powerful and
active organisation, I felt constrained to add he <em>would live
six weeks</em>. I held the envelope, with its contents, in my left
hand, and wrote the impressions as they came with my right.
I remember hesitating about sending that letter, but eventually
sent it. The accuracy of my diagnosis, description of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the patient, and the fulfilment of the prophecy as to his death
were substantiated in a Swansea paper, <cite>The Bat</cite>. The
patient was no other than Captain Hudson, the British
master mariner who sailed the first ship on teetotal principles
from a British port, and who subsequently became one of the
most powerful of British mesmerists. The lady who sent the
lock of hair was his wife, and the lady who contributed the
letter to the papers was his widow. Of similar experiences
Mrs. Coates and I have had many.</p>


<h3>HOW TO CULTIVATE THE PSYCHOMETRIC FACULTY.</h3>

<p><i>Class Experiments.</i>—The sensitives are not to be magnetised
or unduly influenced by positive manner and suggestions,
but are to sit in their normal state (and without mental effort
or straining to find out what they have in their hands), and
simply give expression to their impressions—sensations, tastes,
etc., if any, and no matter how strange to them these may
be. Let the experimenter or operator place different metallic
substances in their hands, taking care that these substances
are carefully covered with tissue paper or other light substance,
which will help to hide their character, and at the same time
not prevent their influence being imparted, or try them
with medical substances. In those sufficiently sensitive, an
emetic will produce a feeling of nausea. The substance
must be put down before it causes vomiting. Geological
specimens can be given—a shell, a tooth, or tusk. Let
the experimenter record the utterances patiently, and seek
confirmation of the description from an examination of the
specimen subsequently. He should not know what special
specimen it is previous to the psychometer’s declared
opinion. Good specimens are best. Thus a fragment of
pottery, a piece of scori, or a bit of brick from, say, Pompeii
would present material from which the psychometrist
could glean strong and vivid impressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>If a medical man is not satisfied as to the correct pathological
conditions of his patient, he might ask the psychometer
to take some article of the patient in hand, and get, in the
sensitive’s own—and therefore very likely untechnical—language,
what he feels and sees regarding this particular
patient’s case. Unsuspected abscesses and tumours have
been correctly pointed out in this way.</p>

<p>In the same way a correct diagnosis of character can be
given in many instances more correctly, more subtle, and
penetrating in detail, than estimates built upon mere external
and physical signs of temperament and cranial contours.</p>

<p>Lay a coin on a polished surface of steel. Breathe upon
it, and all the surface will be affected save the portion on
which the coin lay. In a few minutes neither trace of
breathing nor of the coin are likely to be seen on the
surface of the polished steel. Breathe again, and the
hitherto unseen image of the coin is brought to light. In
like manner, everything we touch records invisibly to us
that action. Hand your sensitive a letter which has been
written in love or joy, grief or pungent sorrow, and let them
give expression to their sensations. As the breath brought
back the image on the steel, so will the nervous and the
psychic impressionability of the sensitive bring to light the
various emotions which actuated the writers who penned the
letters. Mr. G. H. Lewes says “that he has brushed the
surface of the polished plate with a camel’s-hair brush, yet
on breathing upon it the image of the coin previously laid
upon it was distinctly visible.” The mere casual handling of
letters by intermediates will not obliterate the influence of
the original writers; they have permeated the paper with
their influence, so that, if a score or more of psychometrists
held the paper, they would coincide, perhaps not in their
language, but in their descriptions of the originals and the
state of their minds while writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p>The experimenter may help, by asking a few judicious
but not leading questions, to direct and guide the attention
of the psychometrist. The description will be a capital
delineation of the individual who wrote the letter. We
have frequently tested the sincerity of correspondents, real
and other friends, by this process. If the results have sometimes
been unpleasant revelations, we have yet to find in any
case that we have been mistaken. How is the sensitive able
to glean so much of the real character of the original? one is
inclined to ask. While writing, sincerity and earnestness
leave a deeper impression than indifference, pretence, or
ordinary come-to-tea politeness. Some letters are instinct
with the writer’s identity, individuality, masculinity, earnestness,
and enthusiasm. Others are lacking in these things,
because the writers were devoid of these qualities, while
others vary at different times. The writer writes as <em>his soul</em>
moves him, and the writing expresses his aims and hopes as
they appear to his external consciousness. While writing,
<em>his soul</em> draws his image on the paper, and pictures out
thereon his real thoughts; and when the sensitive gets hold
of the letter, outstands the image of the writer and the
imagery of his thoughts. The psychic consciousness of the
psychometer grasps the details and describes them.</p>

<p>“The strange new science of psychometry” is of profound
interest to all. Psychometers are to be found in every
household. The whole subject is one about which a good
deal more could be easily written, but this must do.</p>

<p>Those who desire to understand psychometry cannot do
better than read up fully the literature of the subject, and
those who desire to practise psychometry may do much to
ascertain whether they possess the faculty in any degree; but
all are warned to have nothing to do with persons who
undertake to <em>develop</em> their powers, a <em>self-evident absurdity</em>.</p>

<span class="smcap">Thought-Transference and Telepathy.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Thought-Transference</span> is evidently a phase of psychic
perception. In some respects it bears a greater relation to
feeling than sight. It is distinguished from pure clairvoyance
by the result of experiment. For instance, suppose I
had in the Rothesay case designed M. C., the clairvoyante,
should see “a maid in the room, dressed in a black dress,
with neat white collar and cuffs, wearing a nicely-trimmed
white apron, and a white tulle cap with bows and streamers,
or that a black-and-white spotted cat lay comfortably coiled
up upon the hearth-rug, or some other strongly-projected
mental image.” Now, suppose while M. C. was examining
the room, she declared she <em>saw</em> the maid, and described her,
or the cat, or other objects projected from my mind, and
described these, then this would be a case of thought-transference.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between thought-transference and
thought-reading. It is no mere fanciful distinction either.
Thought-transference occurs when the ideas, thoughts, and
emotions of one mind are projected by intense action and
received by the sensitive and impressionable mind of
another—awake or asleep is immaterial—so long as it occurs
without pre-arrangement and contact.</p>

<p>Telepathy is a more vivid form of sudden and unexpected
thought-transference, in which the intense thoughts and
wishes of one person, more or less in sympathy, are suddenly
transferred to the consciousness of another. The thoughts
transmitted are often so intense as to be accompanied by the
vision of the person, and by the sound of their voice.</p>

<p>Telepathy bears about the same relation to thought-transference
as “second sight” does to clairvoyance. Thought-transference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
and clairvoyance can be cultivated. Not so
telepathy and second sight. They are phenomena, which
belong to the unexpected, portents of the unusual, or sudden
revelations of what is, and what is about to happen. Doubtless,
there are conditions more favourable than others for
inception of these. One needs to be “in spirit on the
Lord’s day,” or any day, before telepathic and second sight
messages are secured. Hence it is noticed telepathic revelations
mostly come in the quietude of the evening, just before
sleep, between sleep and waking, and under similar conditions
favourable to passivity and receptivity in the sensitive
or percipient.</p>

<p>In thought-reading both operator and sensitive are aware
that something is to be done, and indications, intentional or
otherwise, are given to make the thought-reader find out
what is required. More or less sensitiveness is required in
both phases. In telepathy and thought-transference the
psychic elements are in the ascendency; in thought-reading
they may be more or less present, but intention, sensitiveness,
and muscular contact are adequate enough, I think, to
account for the phenomena, as witnessed at public entertainments—so
far, at least, as these entertainments are
genuine.</p>

<p>How do we think? what are thoughts? and how are
thoughts transferred? are reasonable questions, and merit
more elaborate solution than is possible in an elementary
work like this.</p>

<p>We think in pictures: words are but vehicles of thought.
In thought-transference we can successfully project actions,
or a series of actions, by forming in our minds a scene or
picture of what is done and what is to be reproduced.
When, however, we think of a sentence consisting of few or
many words, there is nothing more difficult to convey.
Words belong to our external life here, and are but arbitrary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
expressions and signs for what in the internal or soul-life is
flashed telepathically from mind to mind.</p>

<p>Thoughts are things for good or ill, veritable and living
realities, apart from our exterior selves, independent of
words. The more words, often the less thought. Try to
teach a child by the slow, dry-as-dust method of words, and
the road to knowledge is hard and wearisome. Convey the
same thoughts by illustrations and experiments, and the
child’s mind at once grasps the ideas we desire to convey.</p>

<p>Thoughts are living entities (how poor are words!) which
our own souls have given birth to, or created in the intensity
of our love, wisdom, or passion. One Eastern adept has
taught, “A good thought is perpetuated as an active, beneficent
power, an evil one as a malignant demon. The Hindoo
calls this <i>karma</i>. The adept evolves these shapes consciously;
other men throw them off unconsciously.” How true in our
experience! The thoughts of some men blast, while those
of others bless. There is wisdom in thinking deliberately,
intelligently, and therefore conscientiously, not passionately,
impulsively, or carelessly.</p>

<p>In thought-transference the reproduction of exact words
and dates seems to be most difficult. Indeed, the transmission
of arbitrary words and signs is apparently the most
difficult. The reason, I conclude, is, ideas belong to our
inner, real, and spiritual life, and names, words, and dates
to our exterior existence. The ideas can be expressed in the
language of the sensitive, according to culture or the want of
it. If the true lineaments of the picture are given, need we
be too exacting as to the special frame surrounding the
picture?</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the difficulty in transference and the
reading of the exact words, this has also been frequently
done. A very high state of receptivity and sensitiveness,
however, is necessary in the percipient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p>An incident of exact word-reading is related by Gerald
Massey, the distinguished philosopher and poet. Mr.
Massey met Mr. Home at the London terminus just on his
(Mr. Massey’s) arrival from Hertfordshire. Home and he
entered into conversation, during which Home suddenly
said “he hoped Mr. Massey would go on with his poem.”</p>

<p>“What did he mean?” asked Mr. Massey.</p>

<p>“The poem,” replied Home, “you composed four lines of
just now in the train.”</p>

<p>This was surprising to Mr. Massey, who had actually
composed, but had not written, the four lines of a new poem
on the journey. Mr. Massey challenged Mr. Home to
repeat the lines, which Home did word for word.</p>

<p>How are thoughts transferred? No one can positively
say. There are theories enough—the <em>theory of brain-waves</em>
and of <em>a universal impalpable elastic ether</em>, of <em>undulating
motions</em>, or other more or less materialistic hypothesis.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>
<p>We know there are no psychic phenomena without their
corresponding physical correlatives, and, in this life at least,
these are in thoughts evolved without producing corresponding
molecular changes in the brain.</p>

<p>We notice the human brain is capable of being, and is,
acted upon daily by much less subtle influences than mental
impressions. We can appreciate light impinged upon our
cerebral centres at the rate of millions of undulations, and
sound as the result of 20,000 to 30,000 vibrations per second.
So sensitives, when in the mesmeric or psychic states, are
readily acted upon, and respond as in thought-transference
to our thoughts and sensations, and veritably read our minds,
because of the <em>rapport</em> or sympathy thus established.
Whether they become percipients of the nerve-vibrations
which escape from our own <a id="sensoriums"></a><ins title="Original has 'sensorums'">sensoriums</ins> or not, what does it
matter <em>if they can, as they frequently do</em>, read our minds?</p>

<p>“Professor Wheaton,” says Hudson Tuttle, “devised a
means of illustrating sympathy. If a sounding board is
placed so as to resound to all instruments of the orchestra,
and connected by a metallic rod of considerable length with
the sounding board of a harp or piano, the instrument will
accurately repeat the notes transmitted.</p>

<p>“The nervous system, in its two-fold relation to the
physical and spiritual being, is inconceivably more finely
organised than the most perfect musical instrument, and is
possessed of finer sensitiveness.</p>

<p>“It must not be inferred that all minds are equally
receptive. Light falls on all substances alike, but is very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
differently affected by each substance. One class of bodies
absorb all but the yellow rays, another all but the blue,
another all but the red, because these substances are so
organised that they respond only to the waves of the colours
reflected.”</p>

<p>All persons do not hear alike. They receive certain sounds
and are deaf to all others, although the sound-waves strike
all tympanums alike. All persons do not see alike. Some
perceive colours, others cannot distinguish between one colour
and another, or can only see the more striking colours—fineness
of shade they do not perceive. So there are individuals
who cannot receive mental impressions, unless,
indeed, they are conveyed in the baldest and most esoteric
manner. In a word to convey and receive impressions they
must be sent along the line of the least resistance, that of
<em>true sympathy</em>. There must be one mind adequate to the
projection, and another mind sufficiently sensitive to receive
and record the thoughts projected.</p>


<h3>TRANSFERENCE OF TASTE IN THE MESMERIC STATE.</h3>

<p>The operator will slowly eat or taste half-a-dozen lozenges
or sweets of different flavours, and the subject or sensitive
most in sympathy with him will also in imagination eat of
and describe the taste of the various sweets, concerning
which he has no other knowledge than the thoughts of
eating and tasting, which are transmitted to him from the
brain of the operator. The mere eating of the lozenges by
the operator, without his being fully aware of the fact, will
deepen the impression on the operator’s mind, and help to
concentrate his energies for the transmission of his ideas or
mental suggestions to his subject.</p>

<p>A step or two further and we find with greater sensitiveness
the sensitives can read the thoughts of the operator,
whether the thoughts were transmitted intentionally or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span></p>

<p>“We are compelled (says Dr. Hands) to acknowledge
that certain emanating undulations from the sensorium can
generate different series of thoughts, and that the trembling
organisation, or parts of it, can, by flinging or throwing off
distinct or particular pulsatory waves, inoculate or produce
like vibrations in another person’s brain, making up in it
identical thoughts, <a id="followed"></a><ins title="Original has 'following'">followed</ins> by like feelings, and often in
this way, perhaps, capable of inciting, <em>through sympathy</em>,
like enactments of deeds and pursuits.”</p>


<h3>THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE IN DREAMS.</h3>

<p>The following interesting letter appeared in <cite>The Phrenological
Magazine</cite> (p. 260, April, 1890), and as I know of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona-fides</i> of the writer, I have much pleasure in reproducing
it:—</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—This morning, at a little before four o’clock,
I awoke as the outcome of great mental distress and grief
through which I had just passed in a dream, my body
trembling and in a cold perspiration. I had been walking
with my little boy, aged five and a half years, and some
friends. A heavy rain overtaking us, we stood up for
shelter; and venturing forth into a maze of streets, I missed
my two friends, who, threading among the people, had
turned into a side street without my noticing. Looking for
them, my boy slipped from me, and was lost in the crowd.
I became bewildered by the strange labyrinth of streets and
turnings, and quickly taking one of them which gave an
elevated position, I looked down on the many windings,
but could nowhere see my boy. It was to me an unknown
locality, and, running down among the people, I was soon
sobbing aloud in my distress, and calling out the name of
the child, when I awoke. With wakefulness came a sense
of relief and thankfulness. Gladly realising that the whole
was only a dream, and still scarcely awake, I was startled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
by a cry of terror and pain from an adjoining bedroom—such
a cry as could not be left unheeded. It came from the same
child, and pierced me with a distinct sense of pain. I was
immediately by his side. My voice calmed him. ‘I thought
I was lost’ was all he could say, and doubtless he was soon
composed and asleep again. To me the coincidence was too
remarkable and without parallel in my own experience.
Later on, at breakfast, the child gave further his dream that
he <em>had been out with me and was lost</em>. I am only familiar
with such things in my reading. Mr. Coates’s article in last
month’s <cite>Phrenological Magazine</cite> (page 143) mentions that,
‘when the Prince Imperial died from assegai thrusts in
Zululand, his mother in England felt the intensity of his
thoughts at the time, felt the savage lance pierce her own
side, and knew or felt at the time that she was childless.’
But I am not of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spirituelle</i> type, with only a thin parchment
separation between this life of realities and the great
beyond, of those who, privileged to live in close touch with
the future, are the subjects of premonitions and warnings.
My spirituality 4 to 5 and reflectives 6 point rather the other
way, but I shall, nevertheless, hold tight to the lad. What
is the underlying cause of the coincidence? Which of the
two minds influenced the other, if either?—Yours truly,</p>

<p class="smcap right">“G. Cox.</p>
<p>“16 Bramfield Road,<br />
Wandsworth Common, April 20, 1890.”</p>

<p>In this case of thought-transference, I am inclined to the
opinion that the father’s mind influenced that of the boy, the
son being the more sensitive of the two. Mr. Cox dreamt
an ordinary but pretty vivid dream, which aroused from its
nature vivid and intense anxiety on his part. A similar
train of thought was awakened in the child. If thought-transference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
occurs in waking life, why not in sleep, when,
as abundant telepathic instances testify, the phenomenon is
of most frequent occurrence.</p>


<h3>THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE AT SEA.</h3>

<p>The percipient was Captain G. A. Johnson, of the
schooner “Augusta H. Johnson.” He had sailed from
Quero for home. On the voyage he encountered a terrible
hurricane. On the second day he saw a disabled brig, and
near by a barque. He was anxious to reach home, and,
thinking the barque would assist the brig, continued on.</p>

<p>But the impression came that he must turn back and board
the brig. He could not shake it off, and at last he, with
four men, boarded the brig in a <a id="dory1"></a><ins title="Original has 'dorry'">dory</ins>. He found her deserted,
and made sail in her. After a time they saw an
object ahead, appearing like a man on a cake of ice. The
<a id="dory2"></a><ins title="Original has 'dorry'">dory</ins> was again manned, and set to the rescue. It proved
to be the mate of the barque “Leawood” clinging to the
bottom of an overturned boat, which, being white, appeared
in the distance as ice.</p>

<p>The captain’s sensitiveness may have been aroused by the
exhaustion of so much wakefulness and care during the
length of the storm, the sight of the derelict and deserted
brig; at the same time the premonitions were opposed to his
own desire and anxiety to get home.</p>


<h3>THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE FROM THE DYING TO THE
LIVING IN DREAM.</h3>

<p>The following, by E. Ede, M.D., of Guilford (J.S.P.R.,
July, 1882):—</p>

<p>“Lady G. and her sister had been spending the evening
with their mother, who was in her usual health and spirits
when they left her. In the middle of the night the sister<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
awoke in a fright, and said to her husband, ‘I must go to
my mother at once; do order the carriage. I am sure she is
ill.’ The husband, after trying in vain to convince his wife
that it was only a fancy, ordered the carriage. As she was
approaching the house, where two roads met, she saw lady
G.’s carriage. When they met, each asked the other why
she was there. The same reply was made by both—‘I
could not sleep, feeling sure my mother was ill, and so I
came to see.’ As they came in sight, they saw their
mother’s confidential maid at the door, who told them when
they arrived that their mother had taken suddenly ill, and
was dying, and had expressed an earnest wish to see her
daughters.”</p>

<p>The percipients having been so lately in company and
sympathy with their mother possibly rendered them more
susceptible to her influence.</p>


<h3>THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE FROM THE DEAD (?) TO THE
LIVING IN DREAM.</h3>

<p>Related by Mr. Myers, page 208, Proceedings S.P.R.,
July, 1892:—</p>

<p>“About March, 1857, Mrs. Mennier, in England, dreamt
that she saw her brother, whose whereabouts she did not
know, standing headless at the foot of the bed with his
head lying in a coffin by his side. The dream was at once
mentioned. It afterwards appeared that at about the time
the head of the brother seen, Mr. Wellington, was actually
cut off by the Chinese at Sarawak.” On this case, Mr.
Gurney remarks—“This dream, if it is to be telepathically
explained, must apparently have been due to the last flash
of thought in the brother’s consciousness. It may seem
strange that a definite picture of his mode of death should
present itself to a man in the instant of receiving an unexpected
and fatal blow; but, as Hobbes said, ‘Thought is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
quick.’ The coffin, at <a id="rate"></a><ins title="Original has 'anyrate'">any rate</ins>, may be taken as an item of
death-imagery supplied by the dreamer’s mind.”</p>

<p>“We have now, however,” says Mr. Myers, “seen a
letter from Sir James Brookes (Rajah of Sarawak), and an
extract from the <cite>Straits Times</cite> of March 21st, 1857, in the
(London) <cite>Times</cite> for April 29th, 1857, which makes it, I
think, quite conceivable that the dream was a reflection of
knowledge acquired after death, and the head on the coffin
had a distinct meaning.” Sir James Brookes says:—“Poor
Wellington’s remains were consumed [by the Chinese]; his
head, borne off in triumph, alone attesting his previous
murder.” The <cite>Straits Times</cite> says:—“The head was given
up on the following day. The head, therefore, and the
head alone, must have been buried by Mr. Wellington’s
friends; and its appearance in the dream <em>on the coffin</em>, with
a headless body standing beside it, is a coincidence even
more significant than the facts which Mr. Gurney had before
him when he wrote.”</p>

<p>The transmission of thought from a spirit discarnate to one
incarnate, whose body was asleep, should not be esteemed
impossible. Abundant instances, equally well substantiated,
might be recorded did space permit.</p>


<h3>THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE IN PRAYER.</h3>

<p>This may be a common experience, but only once in my
life have I had conscious knowledge of anything so remarkable.
For some years before devoting my attention to these
subjects, I resided in Liverpool, and had been a member of
the Zion Methodist Church, or Chapel, in Everton, and in
time was duly placed on the local preachers’ plan. In this
capacity I became acquainted with a worthy old man—a
chapel-keeper, who looked after the meeting house situated
in —— street. He had been an old soldier, and possessed
something of the faith of the Roman centurion. Poor in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
things of this world, he was rich in the sublimity of his love
to God and the nobility and purity of his life. I never think
of “Old Daddy Walker” but his character and this incident
comes to my mind, viz.:—One morning I was hurrying down
West Derby Road to business, and, indeed had got halfway
down Brunswick Road, when I commenced to think about
old Walker (I had not seen or thought of him for some
months). I attempted to throw aside my impressions, as
passing thoughts. No use. I became worried about him,
and was asking myself questions. “Was he ill?” “Maybe,
he is in want?” “I think I will hurry back and see?” I
had not much time to spare. It would consume fully twenty
minutes to walk back. After hesitating, I went up Brunswick
Road and up West Derby Road, and to —— Street,
and tapped at the door of his house. There was no response.
The street door was slightly ajar. I went in, and found the
old pair on their knees in the kitchen. He was engaged in
earnest prayer. After kindly salutations, I apologised for
intruding, and told him, as I went to business, “I had been
bothered about him in my mind, and did not feel satisfied
until I had seen him, and knew the truth.” He told me,
as near as I can recollect, “He was at his last extremity.
There was no food or fuel in the house, he had no money,
and he had been putting the whole case before the Lord.”
I had half a sovereign about me, which I had taken out of
the house for an entirely different purpose. This I gave to
him. The old man, rubbing a tear from his eye, looking at
his wife, said: “Mary, don’t thee doubt the Lord anymore.
I said He would help, and He has given me what I asked
for.” Old Walker went on to explain, not only his bad fix,
but that he had no money to buy firewood with. He meant
that he bought up old wood and tar-barrels, which he cut up
into lengths and made into bundles, and sold for firewood;
and that he had asked the Lord for ten shillings, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
wanted that sum to buy a certain lot which could be obtained
for that amount. The old man obtained what he asked for.
He believed the Lord had answered his prayer.</p>


<h3>THOUGHT TRANSMISSION IN PRAYER.</h3>

<p>Since writing the above, the following came under my
notice. In the J.S.P.R., May, 1885, Dr. Joseph Smith,
Warrington, England, says:—</p>

<p>“I was sitting one evening reading, when a voice came to
me, saying: ‘Send a loaf to James Grady’s.’ I continued
reading, and the voice continued with greater emphasis, and
this time it was accompanied with an irresistible impulse to
get up. I obeyed, and went into the village and bought a
loaf of bread, and, seeing a lad at the shop door, I asked
him if he knew James Grady. He said he did, so I bade
him carry it and say a gentleman sent it. Mrs. Grady was
a member of my class, and I went next morning to see what
came of it, when she told me a strange thing <a id="toher"></a><ins title="Original has 'happened her'">happened to her</ins>
last night. She said she wished to put the children to bed,
they began to cry for want of food, and she had nothing to
give them. She then went to prayer, to ask God to give
them something. Soon after which the lad came to the door
with the loaf. I calculated, on inquiry, that the prayer and
the voice I heard exactly coincided in point of time.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">“More things are wrought by prayer</div>
    <div class="verse">Than this world dreams of.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Those who know anything of Methodism, will know this.
The Methodists have a profound faith in prayer, and also
there is a very close relationship between a class-leader and
his members. Dr. Smith was, therefore, all the more likely
to be the percipient of the woman’s earnest and intense
prayer to God to feed her hungry children. The Infinite
must have an infinite variety of ways of fulfilling His own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
purposes. Is it unreasonable to suppose that prayer to Him
may not be answered indirectly “through means”? and that
thought-transference, as in this instance, may be one of the
means? If not, why not?</p>

<p>Charitable institutions are maintained; orphans saved,
reared, and educated; missions of mercy organised, and the
necessary means found by the agency of prayer. Beside
“the angels,” in That Sphere just beyond the ken of the
physical, may not our waves of thought, projected by prayer,
be impinged upon, and directly affect susceptible minds in
this world, by directing their attention to those works of
faith and goodness? Prayer is the language of love, and
the outcome of true helplessness and need. A praying man
is an earnest man. In prayer thoughts are things—bread
upon the waters.</p>


<h3>THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE IN DISTRESS.</h3>

<p>I withhold the names for family reasons. Mr. —— had
been in business in Glasgow for nearly thirty years, and,
from comparatively small beginnings, had been very successful.
Latterly, he and his family resided in ——,
a suburb of Glasgow. Both in the city and in this district
Mr. —— was very much respected, being a church member
and holding office in —— Free Church. For some time
Mr. —— had been ailing, and his medical attendant advised
him to take a sea voyage—a thorough change, etc. In compliance
with this advice, he took a trip up the Mediterranean.
Miss ——, a distant relative of his, had been visiting Glasgow,
and, being on terms of intimacy with the family, knew
of his departure from Glasgow. About two weeks after he
left, she also left Glasgow for Edinburgh. While in the
train for Edinburgh, she was overcome with great anxiety
for Mrs. ——, his wife. Unable to shake the feeling off,
instead of going to Edinburgh, she actually got out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
train halfway, at Falkirk, and took the next train back to
Glasgow, and went to her friend’s house, whom she found
in great distress. Mrs. —— had, about the time Miss —— became
distressed in the train, received word that her husband
was found dead (having committed suicide) in his berth
on the steamer at Constantinople. The state of mind of
the newly-made widow re-acted on that of Miss ——. As
Miss —— was not only a dear friend, but was noted for her
earnest piety, the widow at once earnestly desired to see her.
When last these two friends saw each other, everything
seemed to contribute to happiness and comfort. Mrs. ——
was looking forward hopefully for the return of her husband,
restored in health, to herself and children.</p>


<h3>THOUGHT TRANSFERENCE IN ORDINARY EXPERIENCE.</h3>

<p>Whether thought-transference is a “relic of a decaying
faculty,” or the “germ of a new and fruitful sense,” daily
experience in the lives of most furnish abundant evidence of
the existence of such a power. My own life has supplied me
with abundant evidence of the fact. It is a common occurrence
with us for either my wife or I to utter or give expression
to the thoughts which, for the time being, occupied the
conscious plane in the other. It is possible there may have
been, as there has been in some instances, some half phrase
uttered or manner shown, which in the one have aroused the
thoughts expressed by the other.</p>

<p>It has been our habit for several years to stay at Rothesay
during the summer season. As an instance of thought-transference
quite common in our experience;—On Saturday,
1st October, 1892, I went to the Revision Court at the Town
Hall to hear registration disputes settled between Tory and
Gladstonian lawyers. Finding nothing to interest me, I
entered into conversation with Mr. Thompson, jeweller and
hardware merchant, whom I met in the Court, and went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
with him to his shop in Montague Street, Rothesay. Standing
at his door a short time, I <a id="noticed"></a><ins title="Original has 'notice'">noticed</ins> a solitary pair of
shamrock earrings, composed of crystal brilliants and gold,
lying on a tray, with a number of other earrings, in one of
the windows. I inquired the price, as I felt sure Mrs.
Coates would be pleased with them. They were packed up
in a neat box, and I took them home. At dinner, I gave
the box to my wife, who said, “What is this, papa?”</p>

<p>“Open and see,” I replied.</p>

<p>Animated with a little curiosity, she did, and, as soon as
she saw the earrings, said, “Thompson’s! Well, papa, that
is funny. James (my little son) and I stood at Thompson’s
window last night, and I admired these earrings. I thought
them so neat, and that they would match my brooch. I
thought I would like to have them, and then I thought to
myself, no; I will not spend the money. I pointed them
out to James, and said to him, I am sure if papa saw them,
he would buy them—and here you have brought them home.
I cannot tell you how much I prize them.”</p>

<p>My little boy said, “Thought-reading again, papa!” and,
with a good laugh, we proceeded to discuss our dinner.
Mrs. Coates had not been in the habit of seeing this particular
window, and I am not in the habit of buying
jewellery.</p>

<p>I record this trifle here, as one of our common experiences,
and I am satisfied similar experiences are common
to all.</p>

<p>Another experience is the anticipation of letters and their
contents. This is most frequent in the morning, just before
rising. I frequently see the letters and the shape of the
envelope and style of address before I actually see the letters
on my consulting table.</p>

<p>The most common experience of all is recognised by the
adage, “Think of the Devil, and he will appear.” I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
noted this in particular. Sitting at the table, there is
“popped” into my mind a thought of someone. I will
remark, “I think Mr. or Mrs. —— will be here to-day,”
and they come. Certainly, all who have come in this way
have been relatives or friends; and although they appear
subsequent to the thought of them, the evidence in favour
of thought-transference may not be esteemed conclusive. I
say it is a common experience. I don’t think we should
despise any experience, because it is common. To be common,
indicates there is a basis, amounting to a psychic law,
to account for its existence.</p>

<p>Another common experience is the crossing of letters.
One person suddenly recollects “So-and-so;” and writes
them a letter excusing delay in writing, retailing news, and
in all probability writing on some subject more particularly
than on others. Strange to say, the person you have written
to, has also been engaged writing to you about the same time
and on similar subjects. Both have possibly posted their
letters at such a time that the delivery has been crossed. I
do not say this proves anything; yet I cannot help thinking
the experience is too frequent to be accounted for by the
usual explanation of accident or coincidence.</p>

<p>Mark Twain’s article on “Mental Telegraphy” is fresh in
the minds of most magazine readers. Whether that article
had a basis in the writer’s actual experience or not, it is a
pretty common experience with most literary men.</p>

<p>“Distance,” says Mr. Tuttle, “has inappreciable influence
on the transference of thought. It may take place in the
same room, or where the two persons are thousands of miles
apart. As a personal experience, I will relate one of many
similar incidents which have awakened my attention to this
wonderful phenomenon. Sitting by my desk one evening,
suddenly as a flash of light, the thought came to write an
article for the <cite>Harbinger of Light</cite>, published at Melbourne,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Australia. I had, by correspondence, become acquainted
with the editor, W. H. Terry, but there had been no letters
passed for many a year. I had not thought of him or his
journal for I do not know how long a time, and I was
amused at first with the idea of writing on the subject
suggested. But the impression was so strong that I prepared
and forwarded an article. Nearly two months passed
before I received a letter from Mr. Terry, requesting me to
write an article on the subject on which I have written;
and, making due allowance for time, the date of our letters
were the same. In our experience, this crossing of letters
answering each other has twice occurred—the second by
Mr. Terry answering a request of mine.”</p>

<p>Dr. Charles W. Hidden, of Newburyport, Mass., U.S.A.,
reports a somewhat similar experience to that of Mark Twain
and the above, which was reported in a recent number of
the <cite>Religio-Philosophical Journal</cite>: A very peculiar plot
impressed itself upon his mind, and he immediately based a
story upon the plot. He read the story to his family, and
was about to send it to a publication to which his wife had
recently become a subscriber. When the next number arrived
he opened it to learn how to forward his manuscript, and great
was his surprise to find on the first page a story bearing the
title of his own, and a plot almost identical with that which
he had written. Parts of the published article appeared
word for word. It is needless to add that Dr. Hidden
tossed his manuscript into his desk, and it is there yet. His
explanation is, that he caught the title and the plot from
another, just as Mark Twain caught the plot of the “Big
Bonanza” from his friend Simmons.</p>

<p>It would be nigh impossible to illustrate the various phases
of thought-transference, ranging, as they do, from the association
of ideas which may be aroused by a hint, a half-uttered
word, or a gesture, to the unmistakable facts of pure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
mental transference, and, higher still, to the region of pure
psychism, where spirit influences inspire and direct spirit,
and thought-bodies are no longer recognised as mere subjective
spirits but living and tangible objective personalities,
albeit discarnate.</p>

<p>We can say truly with Voltaire, “There is a power that
acts within us, without consulting us.”</p>

<span class="smcap">Thought-Reading Experiments.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> satisfactory evidence of the reality of thought-transference,
it would be interesting to know if this power
or faculty can be cultivated, and if so, how? I propose in
this chapter to show how this can be done, and how to give
thought-reading entertainments.</p>

<p>Experimental mind-reading may be distinguished, for
the sake of study, as the abnormal, the normal, and the
spurious.</p>

<p>The abnormal, that which takes place in trance, dream,
vision, or which may be the product of artificial somnambulism
or of some super-sensitive condition of the nervous system,
through disease. We observe thought-transference in these
conditions, rather than attempt to cultivate it.</p>

<p>The normal, where the phenomena takes place in the
ordinary waking state, <em>without muscular contact</em>.</p>

<p>The spurious mind-reading, so-called, as the result of
musculation or <em>contact</em>, but which is, in fact, only muscle-reading.</p>

<p>In both the abnormal and normal, direct transference of
thought from mind to mind can only take place when there
is the necessary development of psychic activity in the agent
or operator, and the equally necessary sensitiveness in the
sensitive or percipient.</p>

<p>Classed under muscle-reading are those performances and
games in which the sensitive reads not the mind, but
some special desire (of those with whom he or she may
be placed <em>in contact</em>), by a “careful study of the indications
unconsciously given by the agent or operator to the
percipient or reader.”</p>

<p>In both abnormal and normal thought-reading, then, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
presented innumerable instances of the possession of psychic
faculties; in the muscle-reading phase there may be, and it
is possible all successful “readers” have, more or less
sensitiveness, to take impressions.</p>

<p>To cultivate mind-reading in a sensitive, the operator
should first cultivate in himself the habit of projecting
mental pictures, and think of things as seen by the eye,
rather than as described by words. This is best done by
calling to mind a landscape or domestic scene, by conceiving
and mentally building up the same, and, by degrees, getting
each feature or detail well stamped in his mind.</p>

<p>It is well in the beginning of these experiments to make
the scene as simple, and yet as natural and as complete in
detail, as possible. For instance, let the operator think of
such a picture as this:—A bright little landscape, having a
well-defined cottage on the left, just on the margin of a
small lake; boat with two figures in the foreground; rising
bank upon the right; and a little higher up a defined windmill,
well thrown out by the perspective of blue-ridged and
undulating mountains, and sky in the background.</p>

<p>The agent, having satisfied himself of his sensitive’s whole
or partial powers of psychic perception, might ask:—“Do
you see anything now?” and quickly and deliberately go to
work, meanwhile formulating definitely such a picture as the
above; even allowing himself to get into ecstacies over the
scene—peopling the cottage and the mill, and introducing
imaginary conversation between the individual dwellers
therein, and so on. The sensitive will describe the whole as
the same is <em>felt</em> or perceived. This experiment may appear
to some to be impossible, but the word impossible belongs
to the limitations of sense, and not to the range of the things
possible to the human spirit.</p>

<p>Some sensitives and mediums take impressions from their
surroundings—their clairvoyant revelations are often nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
more than so much Mind-reading. <em>Nothing more</em>; but this
nothing more is a great deal. Certainly, it may not prove
the existence of spirit, apart from the sensitive’s own powers;
but it does prove that man has other avenues of knowledge
than those with which he is usually credited.</p>

<p>The development of mind-reading in the psychic states
may be encouraged by a little judicious assistance or direction.
Invite the sensitive to pay attention to So-and-so; to
visit places, to examine rooms, or describe people whom the
sensitive has never seen. But the places, the rooms, and
the persons must be <em>distinctly in the minds</em> of those persons,
or agents, with whom he or she is placed in <em>rapport</em>.</p>

<p>During these experiments the sensitive will say, “I <em>see</em>
this,” or describe that other, as if he actually saw. Hence
the infinitely close relationship of mind-reading to clairvoyance.
Thought-reading in spiritualism will be referred
to in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Once possessing a good sensitive, the development of the
power, as a matter of fact, lies particularly in the operator’s
ability to concentrate and focus his thoughts—to think clearly,
calmly, vividly, and distinctly himself—and to deliberately
and conscientiously project the same.</p>


<h3>THE NORMAL EXPERIMENTS WITHOUT CONTACT.</h3>

<p>A pleasant hour or so can be profitably filled up on a
long winter’s evening with experiments in mind reading,
without resorting to mesmerism. It will be found that there
are mind-readers in every family—some boy, girl, or young
woman more sensitive than the rest to impressions.</p>

<p>Sometimes it has been found, when two or more persons
think of the same object, as in the “willing game,” the
impression becomes more vivid, and the sensitive finds, or
describes, the article, or thing, more easily. It has been
left to the versatility of Professor Lodge, of the University<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
College, Liverpool, to project two distinct images at the
same time to a sensitive. He requested two friends to look
at a paper that he had given to each. On one paper a
square was drawn, and on the other an oblique cross.
Neither person knew what the other was looking at, and
after they had looked intently at these diagrams for a short
time, the sensitive, who was in a normal condition, but
blindfold, said:—“I see two figures—first I see one, and
then, below that, another. I do not know which I am to
draw. I cannot see either plainly.” Having been requested
to draw what she saw, she drew a square, with an oblique
cross inside of it. On being questioned, she replied that she
did not know why she placed the cross in the square. The
two images projected by distinct minds, intermingled, and
were produced, as narrated by Professor Lodge. We can
readily see that confusion will arise where a number of
persons are thinking of different subjects, or when some
positive-minded individual declares mind-reading to be an
impossibility.</p>

<p>Something after the above experiments of Professor
Lodge are those which were conducted by Mr. Guthrie, a
London barrister, and reported by him to the Society of
Psychical Research.</p>

<p>A number of diagrams, roughly drawn off-hand at the
time, were shown to the agent or precipitant, Mr. G., the
subject, or percipient, a lady, being blind-fold. During the
process of transference, the agent looked steadily and in
silence at the drawing, the subject meanwhile sitting
opposite to him, and behind the stand on which the drawing
lay, so that it was entirely out of her range of vision had
her eyes not been blind-folded.</p>

<p>The agent stopped looking at the drawing when the
subject professed herself ready to make the attempt to
reproduce it. The time occupied thus was from half a
minute to two or three minutes. Then the handkerchief was
removed, and she drew with a pencil what had occurred to
her mind.</p>

<p class="pfs90 p2">RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.</p>
<img class="w100" src="images/exp2.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The reproductions were made generally without the agent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
following or watching the process. We reproduce several of
the attempts here, giving both the successes and the failures.
Even the failures show the effect Mr. G. produced upon the
reader’s mind.</p>

<p>The experiments conducted so successfully in the family
of the Rev. Mr. Creery, of Boston, and made public by
Professor Barrett in <cite>The Journal of Psychical Research</cite>, show
to what extent thought-reading may be successfully carried
on in the quietude and confidence of a well-regulated family.</p>

<p>The mode of procedure adopted by Professor Barrett to
test the faculty as possessed by the children was as follows:—“One
of the children,” says Professor Barrett, “was sent
into an adjoining room, the door of which I saw was closed.
On returning to the sitting-room, and closing the door also,
I thought upon some object in the house, fixed upon at
random. Writing the name down, I showed it to the family
present, the strictest silence being preserved throughout.
We then all silently thought of the name of the thing
selected. In a few seconds the door of the adjoining room
was heard to open, and after a short interval the child would
enter the sitting-room, generally speaking, with the object
selected. No one was allowed to leave the sitting-room
after the object had been fixed upon, and no communication
with the child was conceivable, as her place was often
changed. Further, the only instructions given to the child
were to fetch some objects in the house that I would think
upon and, together with the family, silently keep in mind,
to the exclusion as far as possible of all other ideas.”</p>

<p>Now, if Professor Barrett had told the children to select a
word, and upon coming into the room were to spell or state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
what the word was, I question if the experiments would have
been so successful. The articles thought of, whether a hair
brush, an orange, wine glass, apple, or a playing card, were
of such a nature that a definite picture or image of the thing
thought of could be formed in the mind. The father, mother,
and even Professor Barrett, seem to have been especially in
<em>rapport</em> with the little sensitives, and thus all the more
readily were they able to transmit the mental picture of the
articles selected. Trick or collusion in this case is absolutely
out of the question. It would be interesting to know if these
young sensitives, who were so bright in 1881, still retain,
or have increased or lost, their powers.</p>

<p>There were 312 trials made during Professor Barrett’s stay
of six days, who adds—“One most striking piece of success,
when the things selected were divulged to none of the family,
was five cards running named correctly on the first trial—the
odds against this happening once in our series, being considerably
over one million to one. We had altogether a
good many similar batches, the two longest runs being eight
consecutive successes, once with cards and once with names,
when the adverse odds in the former case were over one
hundred and forty-two millions to one, and on the latter,
something incalculably greater. <em>Walls and closed doors made
no difference.</em>” [The italics are mine.—J.C.]</p>

<p>Something after the foregoing style are drawing-room
entertainments given. If failure result, no one is blamed,
and ridiculous mistakes only lend pleasure to the company,
where all are known one to the other.</p>

<p>The usual method is to select someone for thought-reader.
Lady or gentleman, matters little. He or she is sent out
of the room. Some one in the room generally takes the
lead, who may suggest the article to be selected and hidden,
which the thought-reader is to find. The article selected
is thought of by the entire company. The reader is to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
to the place where it is, lift it, put it down, or give it to some
one else; or to find a certain book and remove it from its
place on table or elsewhere, and put it somewhere else; to
come in and sit on a certain chair or to lead someone else
to it, or perform whatever other test that is decided upon.
The reader is admitted into the room, and, if at all receptive,
will do or say something like what is desired—often going
direct to the spot, lifting the article, or doing the things
which the company have decided upon.</p>

<p>A good plan is to get the assistance of one or two friends,
use a bag of counters, upon which numbers 10 to 100 are
placed; also a smaller bag with numbers 1 to 9. Let the
sensitive sit at a table in such a position, so as, if not blindfolded,
he or she could not see what the agent has in his
hand. Use the small bag to begin with. Let one friend
hold the bag, another select a number. When both have
carefully looked at it, let it be handed to the agent, who shall
fix his eyes steadily upon the figure, and picture the said
figure on his mind. The sensitive will in one or two minutes
either say or write down what the figure is. If these experiments
become satisfactory, the larger bag can be used. The
experiments with numbers must not be continued too long,
and so weary the faculty. In the same way a number of
simple outline designs can be used—these presented one
by one to the agent or operator—a fish, a boy and barrow,
a fireman with escape, a negro and banjo, a lecturer on platform,
an orange, a book, etc., such as are found in
children’s school books; repeating the same processes as
above. No one must speak but the agent and the percipient,
nor is the agent to know what the numbers or
designs are before the experiments are commenced.</p>

<p>Should failure occur, select another medium. In a company
of twenty to thirty persons it will be very strange if a
good thought-reading sensitive is not found. In which case,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
more serious experiments may be attempted subsequently,
and attain scientific value.</p>

<p>The thought-reader should be blindfolded, and <em>resign</em>
himself to the <em>influence</em> of the agent or operator. Although
he understands that something is expected of him, he is not
to be anxious about what, but simply <em>act</em> as he <em>feels</em> himself
prompted.</p>

<p>In proportion as the sensitive is able to give up
anxiety and desire, so will he be able to become a good
reader.</p>

<p>The operator, or agent, must concentrate his mind upon
what is required, and <em>will</em> the sensitive to do it. When two
or more persons, or all in the room, <em>are</em> concentrating their
minds upon the thing, object, or word, the sensitive may all
the sooner be influenced; but I prefer that one person
should be chosen as the operator, and all intended experiments
be submitted to him.</p>

<p>The process is analogous to that of mesmerism. We see
traces here of the influence of mind over mind. We see the
operator determines and the subject performs, although it
may not be very clear how thought is actually projected, or
in what way it is received, other than already suggested.</p>

<p>Practice makes perfect in this as in other things. Success
is proportionate to success. A reader showing a degree of
susceptibility at first attempts will generally improve by
subsequent efforts. In a similar way, operators will make
headway with practice. Some operators and sensitives will
be successful at first trial; others again have failed after
repeated attempts.</p>

<p>Plenty of time should be taken for all first attempts. Let
the operator, for instance, keep his mind thoroughly fixed
on the object. Should the reader be going away from it, let
the agent strongly wish him to go back, <em>touch</em> it, lift it, etc.,
as previously decided upon by the company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p>All sensitive persons are likely to make good thought-readers;
the less sensitive, muscle-readers.</p>


<h3>MUSCLE-READING ENTERTAINMENTS.</h3>

<p>Thought-transference, like clairvoyance, is unequal in
power and manifestation, even with good percipients, and
cannot be turned on like, and with, the evening gas, to
enlighten and entertain. Hence those enterprising entertainers,
like Bishop and Cumberland, depended on “muscle-reading,”
and “backed-up their show” with tricks, some of
them so puerile and barefaced that a third-rate conjuror
would be ashamed of them.</p>

<p>The general public, however, enjoyed these entertainments.
They were something new, and, like “angel’s visits,” were
few and far between. Not only so, but that wonderful
combination, the general public, saw that these entertainments
were patronised by men of science, such as Carpenter,
Beard, Hammond, Baron Kelvin, and others deeply in
love with strictly materialistic hypothesis. They were also
patronised by “society.” These entertainers undertook to
read thoughts and expose spiritualism; and as the dear
public loves mystery, it went. But the dear public don’t
like to be “taken in,” hence these performances are generally
repeated—in the next town.</p>

<p>The following, reported from St. John’s, N.B., January
17, 1887, in the <cite>Herald</cite>, is a good illustration of the psychic
and muscular indications involved in an experiment of this
kind:—“In a ‘mind-reading’ performance on Saturday night,
after several examples indoors, the ‘reader,’ a young man
who belongs to this city, asked for an outdoor test. The
party separated, one remaining with the reader, and hid a
pin in the side of a little house used by the switchman of the
New Brunswick Railway at Mill Street. In their travels
they went over the new railway trestle, a most difficult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
journey. The reader was blindfolded, and one took his
wrist, but at the trestle hesitated, fearing to venture, and
was told by the reader to let go his wrist and place his hand
on his head. The subject did so, and the reader went upon
the trestle. Some of the party suggested that the bandage
should be removed, but he told them not to mind, and, the
subject again taking the wrist, he went over the ice and
snow-covered sleepers. With a firm step he crossed to the
long wharf, went over as far as the mill gates, then quickly
turned, retraced his steps, and went back to the corner of
Mill Street. Here he rested a minute, then again took the
subject’s hand, and in less than five minutes afterwards found
the pin. At the conclusion of the test, the reader inquired
what the matter had been when they first reached the trestle.
It was easily explained. The storm had covered the sleepers
with snow, and it was thought dangerous, even for a man not
blindfolded to cross them. The subject felt anxious for the
reader’s safety, and hesitated about going across. The tests
were most satisfactory.” Thought or mind-reading applied to
these experiments is a misnomer. If this young gentleman
could “read thoughts” by musculation, or <em>contact</em>, he
would have known what the matter had been when they
first reached the trestle. Muscle-reading is not thought-reading.
Hence it is classified as spurious.</p>

<p>Any number of illustrations could be given of such entertainments.
The foregoing is sufficiently adequate to give
an idea of how these muscle (not thought) reading entertainments
are given.</p>

<p>For drawing-room entertainments, first blindfold the
reader, who is conducted out of the room while the
experiments are decided upon. The blindfolding helps to
mystify friends, who think the work is rendered more
difficult. As a matter of fact, the reader’s work is rendered
much more easy. It helps to isolate him, and leaves his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
mind much less entrammelled by sights and impressions
which would otherwise prevent him receiving <em>the</em> impressions
which it is desirable he should receive.</p>

<p>Suppose the reader is to locate the seat of an imaginary
pain, the assistant or operator <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem.</i> will grasp<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> with his
left hand the sensitive’s right wrist and hold it firmly. While
the reader is endeavouring to locate the pain, the operator
must give up his will, and think intently on the situation of
the pain. The reader will then locate it.</p>

<p>There is less secret in this than appears at first sight. The
sensitive, or reader, is simply guided or led by the operator,
and the reader’s hand either stops partially over or is pressed
upon the seat of the pain. He then declares he has found
the seat of the pain, and points it out accordingly.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar method is adopted in finding the
pin, or the <em>hole</em> in which a pin <em>had been</em>. The racing and
flying about of public thought-readers are only so much
“theatrical side,” thrown in to give dramatic effect to their
performances.</p>

<p>In reading the numbers on bank-notes, or spelling out
certain words, a board with the numerals and the alphabet
(see front cover) is placed in sight of the audience. The
reader takes the wrist of the operator, and, commencing at
the left side of the board, proceeds from figure to figure
till he detects the right one. The operator thinks only of
<em>one</em> figure or letter at a time. This is the whole secret of
“musculation.” Even when the operators are sincere, and
are careful to give no conscious indications to the reader, yet
it is almost certain, if they keep their mind fixed on the
desired figure or letter, object or place, they will unconsciously
indicate to the reader the right number or letter.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span></p>
<p>To find an article, number, or do a certain act, it is necessary
for the reader to give prompt obedience to the indications
given him. The concentration of attention necessary
can only come with practice. No end of surprises and
amusement will follow if the operator honestly concentrates
his mind upon the things to be done, and a good muscle-reader
is found to take up the indications. Apparently,
the most difficult feats are sometimes accomplished.</p>

<p>During the experiments, the reader will have curious
sensations, such as heaviness of feeling, dread and uncertainty,
and then <em>blankness</em> of mind, followed by an impulse
to do something. If the reader can keep his mind passive
enough, he may receive impressions, as in thought-transference;
anyway, it is advisable to wait for the impulse to
move and to do. The highest percentages of success always
follow.</p>

<p>General directions for the cultivation of experimental
thought-transference and mind-reading given in these pages
are sufficiently specific, to be found thoroughly practical
by those who have put them into practice; and certainly
no harm, either mental or physical, can come to those who
are willing to give them a fair trial.</p>

<span class="smcap">Spiritualism.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Any</span> reference to Spiritualism here must be very brief,
and, I am afraid, very incomplete. I will deal with the
subject in the light of the preceding chapters.</p>

<p>It has been established on the clearest evidence that
thought-transference and reception between two nearly
harmonised or sympathetic human beings, or embodied
human spirits, are possible, and this without intermediate
sense or physical agencies. If, then, between mind and
mind on earth, distance or space being no obstacle, matter
no hindrance, why not between mind disincarnate—if we
can conceive of mind apart from the human brain and
organism—and mind incarnate? If not, why not?</p>

<p>It seems to me very difficult, if we accept the first, to
reject the latter conclusion. If we accept the latter, we are
committed in the main to belief in Spiritualism, ancient and
modern. If we admit that it is possible for a disembodied
spirit to communicate with us in dream, vision, or, as in the
case of Miss Howett, have our hands influenced to write, or
that we see and converse with spirits, as in the case of Mary
Reynolds, we then admit, and accept in the main, the
essential features of what is known as Spiritualism. The
subject is not only interesting, but of vital importance;
therefore, I think, the fear of being called a “Spiritualist,”
or any other name, should not prevent us sounding to the
depths, the psychic possibilities of our human nature.</p>


<h3>THE SPIRIT WITHIN US.</h3>

<p>There is Spiritualism <em>and</em> Spiritualism. That which I am
most interested in is not so much a hankering after spirits,
“spirit controls,” and the phenomena, generally recognised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
as the right thing in certain circles, as that other Spiritualism
which leads to an honest endeavour on our parts to ascertain
if we are spirits, here and now, albeit clothed for the time
being in an organic envelope, relating us to our present
estate.</p>

<p>If we are embodied spirits, it will be possible for the
spirit-man (the essential self—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ego</i>, I am), in each human
being to communicate at times, and under certain fitting
conditions, with other fellow-beings, under such circumstances,
and in such a way, as to make it clear:—</p>

<p>(<i>a.</i>) That the communications could not have been transmitted
and received by the ordinary channels, or physical
sense organs, which in ordinary circumstances appear essential
to our exchange of thought.</p>

<p>(<i>b.</i>) That the exchange of thought, in independence of the
ordinary sense channels, will demonstrate that man must
possess other, extraordinary or psychic, organs for the transmission
and the reception of thought.</p>

<p>Both positions I have endeavoured to sustain on the foregoing
pages; and, lastly, concerning spiritualism, I have
arrived at the profound conclusion that spirit-communion—that
is, thought transmission from the disembodied to the
embodied—is a solemn fact. After carefully eliminating all
the possibilities of self-deception—auto-trance, discreet degrees
of consciousness, of natural and acquired clairvoyance,
of thought-transference and mind-reading, and lastly, the
puerile performances of conjurors and the simulated phenomena
of tricksters—there remains evidence of disembodied or
disincarnate spirit, and of such control influencing and
directing the actions of men, just as one man in this life
influences and directs the actions of another.</p>

<p>What I esteem, however, as satisfactory evidence might
not be evidence to another; and I for one do not think it
necessary to open up the life chambers of my psychic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
experiences to the indifferent, the thoughtless, or the sceptic,
to furnish the desired evidence. Others must travel by the
way I have come to understand something of that way. All
men cannot believe alike, hence it will not be surprising that
some will accept as sufficient evidence of spirit what others
would deem insufficient.</p>

<p>It is not my intention meantime to advocate spiritualism.
I only refer to it, in so far as it is related to “How to
Thought-Read.” However, phenomenal spiritualism is not
a matter of belief so much as of evidence, and many eminent
thinkers have been compelled by the force of the evidence
to accept spiritualism now, who, a quarter of a century ago,
would have hesitated, principally through fear of ridicule, to
speak of the subject in language of ordinary civility.</p>

<p>While I am convinced that such communications between
the so-called dead and the living are possible, I do know and
feel satisfied that much which is accepted as evidence of the
existence and influence of spirits by the majority of the unthinking
and excitable crowd who rush after novelties, and
perchance call themselves “spiritualists,” is traceable to
no other or higher source than our own innate, but little
understood, human or psychic powers. I have arrived at
this conclusion also, as the result of carefully investigating
spiritualism, and it is therefore not an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> hypothesis
conveniently elaborated from my own or borrowed from the
brains of others who are opponents to spiritualism. It is
probable, had I not devoted the greater part of my life to
spiritualism, as one of the factors in human character, I
should have known but little of that sympathetic transference
of thought from one mind to another, or of the light
which that fact throws upon our dual or compound existence.</p>

<p>In this “sympathetic transference of thought” we find a
solution to the problem of spiritualism, whether old or new.
I conclude, with Buffon, “The true springs of our organisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
are <em>not</em> these muscles, these veins, these arteries, which
are described with so much exactness and care. There exist
in organised bodies <em>internal forces</em> which do not follow the
gross mechanical laws we imagine, and to which we would
reduce everything.” Or, as Laplace puts it more strongly—“Beyond
the limits of this visible anatomy commences
another anatomy, whose phenomena we cannot perceive;
beyond the limits of this external physiology of forces, of
action, and of motion, exists another <em>invisible physiology,
whose principles, effects, and laws are of the greatest importance
to know</em>.”</p>

<p>It may be esteemed reprehensible to “seek communion
with the dead;” but to know ourselves, to fathom this
<em>invisible physiology</em>, whose principles, effects, and laws are
of such importance to understand, I hold to be not only
legitimate but perfectly laudable. How can we serve God,
whom we have not seen, if we do not understand ourselves,
whom we think we have seen, or the laws which govern
our being, as created by him? To know ourselves as we
should, we ought not to neglect the search for “the spirit
within us.”</p>


<h3>THE REJECTION OF THE PSYCHIC.</h3>

<p>Many persons—scientific, theological, learned, and illiterate—reject
the psychic, and refrain from investigating, either
from constitutional bias or from crass ignorance; and such
have played the part of learned Sadducees or low fellows of
the baser sort before anything having the remotest flavour of
spirit. The man of science is rendered purblind by “my
hypothesis,” the theologian by “my belief,” the man of the
world by “my business” or “my position.” The respectable
church-goer—who vaccinates his children, as he has them
baptised, because it is the proper thing to do—has neither
head nor heart, apparently, to understand anything beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
the common ideas of the hour. He would crucify all new
thought, or new spiritualism for that matter, as the Jews did
Jesus, because the new doctrines promulgated and the new
wonders performed tend to subvert the present respectable
order of things.</p>

<p>The worship of Diana is not confined to ancient Ephesus.
The great Diana of old was the type of that “Respectable
Custom” which the majority of mankind worship and obey
to-day, because, as of yore, it conserves their vested interests,
official connections, and brings them “much gain.” As for
the man in the street—the multitude having no shepherd—he
is always more or less hypnotised by the well-clad and well-fed,
smug-faced worshippers of the aforesaid “Respectable
Custom;” hence he is ever ready to shout “Crucify,” or
“Hurrah,” or aught else he is influenced to do, especially if
such exercises give him pleasure and excitement for the time
being. He accepts or rejects as he sees “his betters” think
best, and so, unfortunately, is unfitted to a large degree, for
the intelligent investigation of his own nature. These form
the largest group of rejectors of the phenomenal evidences
of soul.</p>

<p>The psychic, however, has suffered less from such rejectors
than from those who claim to be recognised and known as
converts and exponents of the same, who at best have only
shown themselves to be “seekers after a sign.” They may
have run into the wilderness and have had a bit of miraculous
bread, and yet not be a pennyworth the better of it in either
soul or body—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, life or conduct. These, by their foolishness,
have prevented many well-meaning and otherwise
able persons investigating the psychic, for the latter saw
nothing in the lives of professed spiritualists to make them
desire to have anything to do with spiritualism. Moreover,
coming in contact with the iconoclastic in spiritualism, they
have become disgusted with the crude and the coarse therein,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
as they have with the revelations, inspirations, and fads,
advocated by certain mediums, and hence have rejected the
wheat because of the apparent great quantity of tares.</p>


<h3>THE FRAUDULENT IN SPIRITUALISM.</h3>

<p>I am afraid the trend of modern civilisation, which leads
men from the beauties and quietude of hill and dale, of
valley and river side, into crowded city life, has tended to
make men exoteric. They run after signs and wonders without,
and too little to the spirit within. The broader view of
being, and that self-culture and purity which arises from
the exercise of man’s innate powers, and makes for true
regeneration and spiritual progress, here and hereafter,
have been more or less sacrificed to the external and the
phenomenal.</p>

<p>The love of the phenomenal, in and out of Spiritualism,
has created a crowd of harpies, impostors, or fraudulent
mediums—male and female—who trade on human credulity,
some to earn a pittance, and others to gratify vanity. Men
and women have been known to risk reputation for both.
In this way Spiritualism has its quota of deceivers and
deceived.</p>

<p>There are some people who must have phenomena, just
as there are other people who will have sermons. If they
don’t get exactly what they want, they withdraw “their
patronage”—the finances. So, if the patronage is to be
retained, phenomena and sermons have to be supplied—if
the first are fraudulent or the latter stolen.</p>

<p>Seeing how fugitive real psychological phenomena are—natural
or induced—one must necessarily hesitate to accept
“trance addresses,” “inspirational orations,” “medical
controls,” clairvoyant, and second-sight exhibitions, which
are supplied to order, to gratify patrons, at so much per
hour. It is human to err, but the manufacturer of spurious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
phenomena, the impostor who trades on the ties, and the
dearest of human affections, is a devil. There is no iniquity
too low—earthly or devilish—to which he will not as readily
descend to gratify his vampirish nature.</p>

<p>I am not disposed to accept the infallibility of spirits for
that of Popes—large or small—or professional media, in
place of professional priests and ministers, and there is by
far too much of this in Spiritualism.</p>

<p>In the foregoing connection, I must refer to another
source of error—this time, however, more related to physical
rather than psychic phenomena—viz., the credulity of those
who are disposed to believe that certain conjurors are
aided in their performances by spirit agency. Personally, I
would sooner believe that mediums for “Physical Phenomena”
resorted to conjuring to aid “spirits,” than believe
that “spirits” resorted to “hanky-panky” to aid conjurors.
No wonder “frauds” smile. Years ago I had to protest
against this absurdity, when people—who ought to know
better—talked this kind of nonsense about conjurors, as
they do about certain fraudulent mediums now—viz., “they
are aided by spirits.” Owing to this lack of discrimination
and want of trained discernment in Spiritualists and the
general public, mediumistic frauds have fooled, to their
utmost bent, fresh groups of dupes at home and abroad.</p>

<p>I am none the less disposed to accept the genuine, because
we recognise sources of error connected therewith, and are
determined to set our faces against palpable frauds.</p>


<h3>SPIRITUALISM WITHOUT SPIRITS.</h3>

<p>We may now turn from the wretched arena of imposture,
duplicity, and credulity, to genuine, but little understood,
phenomena in Spiritualism. We have seen that much which
has been attributed to the agency of disembodied spirits is
due, in many instances, to the action of man’s own psychic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
states, “the double, who is wiser than we,” and to the fact
that, as often as not, trance states, automatic and planchette
writing, are self-induced conditions. Equally so, clairvoyance,
thought-transference, and psychometry do not require
the “agency of spirit” to account for their existence as
“gifts,” qualities or powers. It will be time enough to
admit such agency—that of disembodied spirit—when the
evidence in each particular case is reasonably conclusive.
I think this is the only wise and safe course to pursue.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance may be native or induced, self-cultivated or
cultivated by aid of a mesmerist. As it has been exercised
naturally, and without any such aid, the exhibition of clairvoyance—in
itself—is no evidence of disembodied spirit-presence
or control. Equally, the seeing of, and the describing
of, spirits by a clairvoyant—even if the descriptions
are apparently accurate—may present no evidence of the
real presence of such spirits. I do not deny that clairvoyants
can see spirits, but the mere fact of being able to
see and describe spirits, is not sufficient evidence—the <em>seer</em>
is controlled by spirit-power to see, or that the spirits
described are actually <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona-fide</i> spirits. Frequently, so-called
spirits have no other existence than the image of them
possessed by some positive-minded individual. A clairvoyant,
<em>perceiving</em> these images, might naturally enough
conclude she was actually seeing the spirits which she
described.</p>

<p>If Mr. Stead, for instance, is convinced that “Sister
Dora,” “Cardinal Manning,” or “Lord Tennyson,” are
at his side, in his rooms, influencing and directing his mind,
or at other times actually controlling his arm and hand to
write, a clairvoyant in sympathy with him may describe this
or that other spirit he is <em>thinking</em> about. But that does not
prove the spirit or spirits are actually present.</p>

<p>A lady (Mrs. Davis), whose name has come prominently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
before the public as Mr. Stead’s clairvoyante, being
questioned as to Mr. Stead’s automatic writing and her
own gift, said:—“I know probably more about that than
anyone. I was in his office some time in the beginning of
December last regarding the forthcoming publication of a
book of mine concerning spiritualism. The conversation
turned upon spiritualistic automatic handwriting. I did not
know the deceased lady who was writing through him, but I
saw her behind his chair as distinctly as if she had been in
the flesh. I described her position as she stood and her
appearance. She at once wrote through Mr. Stead’s hand
confirming all I had stated concerning her in my description.
Mr. Stead’s hand continued to write. I knew afterwards it
wrote out a message stating that another spirit was in the
room. Mr. Stead asked me if I could describe that spirit.
I had to wait some little time before I detected it, and there
I recognised as in the flesh a very famous personage recently
dead, whose loss was mourned all the world over in prose
and verse. I carefully described the spirit as he appeared
to me, and then Mr. Stead said I was right. But, I
answered, I see another male spirit. Ask the deceased
lady who is writing through you to write the name of the
last spirit. Mr. Stead’s hand automatically moved, and he
wrote the name of a son of the famous personage already
alluded to.” Mrs. Davis says she has been strongly impressed
with the fact that Mr. Stead has been selected by
the spirits as their champion from the peculiar and unique
position he occupies in the journalistic world, and he will be
the agent who will break through the solid walls of bigotry
and prejudice. Mr. Stead may or may not have written
under spirit influence, and this lady may or may not have
seen spirits as described. We must not conclude in the
latter case that Mr. Stead and his “trustworthy clairvoyante”
are stating anything they do not believe to be true. I believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
she saw, as described or thought of by Mr. Stead, a “deceased
lady;” and that she also saw, as equally thought by him, “a
very famous personage recently dead;” also “another male
spirit,” whose name she did not know until Mr. Stead
wrote the name. This narrative, however interesting as to
automatic writing and spirit agency in the opinions of those
concerned, conveys no tangible evidence of either the one or
the other. To us it is interesting in the fact that Mrs. Davis
<em>saw the spirits thought of by Mr. Stead</em>. We must think
twice before we can accept this as evidence of spirits and
spirit-presence. Although it is possible those concerned
have evidence, we have not. We have, however, evidence
here of thought-transmission and psychic impressionability.</p>

<p>When we read of persons who have been raised up, as
mediums of St. Peter, St. Paul, or St. John, or a publishing
company being run by Shakespeare through a special
medium, and worked by a syndicate of Spiritualists, I think
we are entitled to doubt these claims, even though a dozen
clairvoyants vouched for the existence and presence of the
aforesaid spirits.</p>

<p>Psychometry furnishes evidence that many so-called spirits
are not spirits “at all, at all”—only visions of the originals;
and the fact that such and such an individual has been accurately
described—actions and manners carefully indicated—and
this has been and is accurately done in health and disease
daily—is no evidence, in itself, that psychometers have
seen spirits. Thus, when a psychometer places a geological
specimen to his forehead, and describes an “antediluvian
monster,” roaring and walking about, no one but a very
shallow individual would imagine for a second the psychometer
was actually seeing the original. So many of the spirits
and spectres seen do not proceed from our own brains, but
from objects, relics, and old houses, which had been in times
past impinged by the living presence and magnetism of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
originals. Then we must take into consideration those
spectres which proceed from our own brains, such as the
realistic images which are sometimes projected from the
background of consciousness to our eyes and ears. Many
so-called spirits are simply the product of diseased neurological
conditions, in short, hallucinations, which arise from
some derangement of the optic and auditory centres. The
spectres seen by Nicolai gradually disappeared as he lost
blood, as the prescribed leeches tranquilised his system.
We have no reason to believe the spectres he saw, visions
and what not, were actually either spirits or produced by
spirits.</p>


<h3>MIND-READING IN SPIRITUALISM</h3>

<p class="noindent">is the commonest of most common experiences. I have
known mediums to graphically describe scenes, persons, and
incidents with such vividness as to impress one they must be
controlled by spirits intimately acquainted with the whole
circumstances which were revealed. Closer examination
indicates that all the information so given by these mediums
was based on the thought-read phase. That is, the information
was culled from the minds of spirits in the flesh, and
did not come from disembodied sources.</p>

<p>Some years ago I attended a series of seances in Liverpool.
Nearly all the family were mediums of some sort. I was at
this time very enthusiastic in my investigations. Consequently,
the following incident was not lost upon me. One
evening the circle met, with the usual members. Shortly
after the circle was formed, the daughter of the house went
into the trance state. There were several controls, one of
whom professed to be a man who, the day before, had been
injured on board one of Lambert &amp; Holt’s steamers, which
lay in the Bramley Moore Dock. The “spirit” described
the accident, how he was injured, and that he was carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
to the hospital, and had “passed away.” Owing to the
suddenness of his death, he wished us to communicate with
his family, and desired the circle to pray for him, etc. As
near as I can recollect, when asked for further particulars,
name, family, there was no definite reply. The medium
quivered, and a new control had taken possession of her. I,
however, neither doubted the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona-fides</i> of the spirit nor the
medium. I was especially interested in this control. I
thought this time I had obtained a test of spirit identity.
But alas for the imperfection of human hopes, I was doomed
to disappointment. I clung to the idea the spirit would
come back again, and when he got “more power,” we
would get the particulars he wanted to give us. He did
not come back—and no wonder. Four months subsequently,
I met the real Simon Pure in the flesh.</p>

<p>To explain more fully: On the day previous to the seance
mentioned, I was on board the newly-arrived steamer in
question. The lumpers were getting out the cargo. This
man had been working on the top of the cargo in the main
hold “hooking on.” I paid no particular attention at the
time to him, but an hour after I heard a great outcry,
and saw a rush of men to the main hold. When I
turned back and got there, I found this man senseless and
bleeding.</p>

<p>The hooks had slipped off a bale while easing out some
cargo. One of them had caught the poor fellow in the
mouth, and had torn up his cheek almost to the right ear.
He was to all appearance dying. I temporarily dressed his
face, and the stevedore had him put on a stretcher and sent
to the hospital. <em>I did not know his name or the hospital to
which he was removed.</em> That day and the next the whole
scene was vividly impressed on my mind. Hence that night
the circumstances at the seance seem to me to be quite
natural. Everything advanced was wonderfully apposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and convincing. It was not till I saw the man, and conversed
with him, that my so-called test of spirit identity
resolved itself into so much thought or mind reading, so that,
even presuming the medium or sensitive was controlled by
“a spirit,” there can be no doubt the source of the spirit’s
information was purely mundane.</p>


<h3>AUTOMATIC AND PLANCHETTE WRITING,</h3>

<p class="noindent">upon which so much reliance is placed, as furnishing evidence
of “disembodied spirit control,” presents similar difficulties.
The recording of forgotten incidents, and predicting possibilities
in the future, are not beyond the powers of the innate
human spirit—wholly and utterly unaided by spirit agency.
Therefore automatic writing—when genuine—does not
necessarily furnish evidence of spirit control, not even when
the person who writes believes, and honestly believes too, he
is so controlled to write.</p>

<span class="smcap">Spiritualism.</span>—<i>Continued.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Automatic</span> writing is a phase of phenomenal Spiritualism
most difficult to prove. In the majority of cases we are
reduced to the awkward position of accepting or rejecting
the assertions of the persons who declare that the writing
done by them is automatic—that is, written without thought
and volition on their part. A close examination of this
claim may lead to the conclusion that automatic writing is
not impossible. Whether the controlling agent is “the spirit
within us,” or a disembodied spirit, or both, is not a matter
of much importance, if it is established, the writing is
automatic. When messages are written without volition, in
the handwriting of deceased persons, signed by their names,
such messages must be treated on their merits. I have seen
messages written in this way. I have seen messages
written, not only automatically, but <em>direct</em>. Some were
written the reverse way, and could only be read by holding
up to the light or to a mirror. The direct writing was done
in an exceedingly short time, two or three hundred words
in less time than an expert phonographer could write the
same by the most expeditious efforts. The evidence in
favour of telepathic writing is not very strong, but of <em>direct</em>
writing there appears to be abundant proof.</p>

<p>Dr. Nichols, in his fascinating work, “Forty Years of
American Life,” writes:—“I knew a Methodist sailor in
New York, a simple, illiterate, earnest man, who became
what is called a test medium. He came to see me in
Cincinnati, and one evening we had also as visitors two
distinguished lawyers: one of them a brother of Major
Anderson, “the hero of Fort Sumter;” the other, a gentleman
from Michigan, and one of the ablest lawyers practising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
in the Supreme Court of the United States. I had brought
into the drawing-room a heavy walnut table, and placed it
in the centre of the room. The medium sat down on one
side of it, and the sharp Michigan lawyer, who was a
stranger to us and the medium, on the other. The medium
placed his fingers lightly upon the table. It tilted up under
them, the two legs nearest him rising several inches. The
lawyer examined the table, and tried to give it a similar
movement, but without success. There was a force and a
consequent movement he could not account for. There was
no other person near the table, there was no perceptible
muscular movement, and in no way in which it could be
applied to produce the effect.</p>

<p>“When there was no doubt on this point, the lawyer, at
the suggestion of the medium, wrote with careful secrecy on
five bits of paper—rolling each up like a pea as he wrote—the
names of five deceased persons whom he had known.
Then he rolled them about until he felt sure that no one
could tell one pellet from the other. Then, pointing to
them successively, the tipping table selected one, which the
gentleman, without opening, put in his waistcoat pocket,
and threw the rest into the fire.</p>

<p>“The next step was to write the ages of these five persons
at their death, on as many bits of paper, which were folded
with the same care. One of these was selected, and again,
without being opened, deposited in the lawyer’s pocket,
which now contained a name and a number indicating age.</p>

<p>“With the same precautions the lawyer then wrote, in
the same way, on bits of paper, the places where these
persons died, the diseases of which they died, and the dates
of their decease, going through the same process with each.
He had then in his pocket five little balls of paper, each
selected by a movement of the table, for which no one could
account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<p>“At this moment the hand of the medium seized a
pencil, and with singular rapidity dashed off a few lines,
addressed to the lawyer as from a near relative, and signed
with a name which the medium very certainly had never
heard.</p>

<p>“The lawyer, very much astonished, took from his
pocket the five paper balls, unrolled them, spread them
before him on the table, and read the same name as the
one on the written message, with the person’s age, the place
and time of death, and the disease of which he died. They
all corresponded with each other and the message. No
person had approached the table, and neither lawyer nor
medium had moved. It was in my own house, under a
full gas light, and, so far as I could see, or can see
now, no deception was possible.</p>

<p>“The written communication, which purported to come
from a deceased relative of the gentleman only expressed, in
affectionate terms, happiness at being able to give him this
evidence of immortality.”</p>

<p>This incident is introduced here in illustration of one out
of many phases of mediumship known to spiritualists. We
see here both psychic and physical powers-exercised, not
generally recognised as possible. A massive table moved
without physical leverage or exertion, and “thoughts read,”
which formed the basis of the message. Trickery and
collusion in this instance are absolutely out of the question.
The only questions which remain to answer are: “Did
this medium possess in himself the powers referred to? or
did he possess them in consequence of being controlled by
a disembodied spirit, as claimed by the message?” Although
the message in itself did not contain evidence of any other
source of information than that emanating from the lawyer’s
own mind, we are forced to the conclusion that either the
medium or the spirit controlling the medium had power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
to read his mind, and of exerting what Professor Crookes
and Sergeant Cox would call Psychic Force to move the
table, and indicate what pellets to select. We have here
evidence of an intelligence capable of exercising an unknown
force and of reading thoughts—that intelligence claimed to
be a human spirit.</p>


<h3>TRANCE ADDRESSES.</h3>

<p>Trance and inspirational addresses, however, do not, in
my opinion, furnish much evidence of the reality of spirit
control. We are interested in the phenomena—taking for
granted that these trance and inspirational states are genuine—although
the evidence of external spirit control presented
is often <em>nil</em>. The controls may or may not be veritable
realities to their own mediums—professional or otherwise—but
this is of little value, as evidence, to the public. I have
known mediumistic and otherwise sensitive persons to be
controlled—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, taken possession of by their reading. One
gentleman swallowed large doses of Theodore Parker. In
time he thought of Parker, talked of Parker, and finally
believed he was “inspired” by Theodore Parker. This
<a id="gentleman"></a><ins title="Original has 'gentlemen'">gentleman</ins> had been a Unitarian before being a Spiritualist,
and doubtless his mind had been broadened and brightened
by his course of Theodore Parker; but beyond his own belief
and the evident state of excitability he exhibited when
speaking under this supposed control, there was actually
no evidence of “spirit control” worthy of notice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cora L. V. Tappan-Richmond, an inspirational
medium, from America, delivered a series of remarkable
addresses in this country about twenty years ago. These
were published by J. Burns, of Southampton Row, Holborn,
W.C. A young gentleman from Brighton heard and read
the lectures, and finally budded forth as “an inspirational
speaker.” For a long time the public got nothing but the
Tappan lectures diluted. We had the same marvellous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
even flow, similar processes of reasoning, fertility of illustration,
and unbounded capacity for assertion. No one dare
say this person was not inspired by the spirits. It might
have been a way the spirits had of breaking in their
instrument, but I had a shrewd suspicion the young orator
was controlled by his reading. I don’t know how many
others have been influenced in this way. I have noticed when
a noted medium “came to town,” delivered a number of
addresses in public, or gave seances in private, immediately
thereafter a number of imitators professed—correctly or
otherwise—principally otherwise—to have been controlled
by the guides, who were supposed to control the medium
aforesaid, and that they would soon be able to give
addresses and manifestations, and what not. On the other
hand, the noted mediums averred “their guides never
controlled any other than themselves,” etc. The conscientious
investigator is left to wonder how much imitation,
vanity, and self-deception have to do with such statements.</p>

<p>Some of the most perfect oratory, and some of the ablest
and most cogent lectures and addresses I have ever listened to
have been given by trance and inspirational mediums. It
was stated, as evidence of spirit control, by those who
professed to know, “that these mediums could not reason
and speak that way in their normal condition.” All of which
is worthy of consideration. At the same time I saw nothing
inherently impossible—judging from a physiological or
cerebral-physiognomic standpoint—to prevent these persons
delivering, unaided by spirit agency, the addresses referred
to. That a person speaks with greater ability, intelligence, or
fluency in the trance state compared with his known powers
in the waking state, cannot, alone, be accepted as proof of
spirit control. We have seen hypnotised subjects do the
same. But the reality, or otherwise, of spirit agency, cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
be estimated by the superiority, or otherwise, of the addresses
and messages given.</p>

<p>In all public meetings and in seances where a medium is
expected to give trance and inspirational addresses the
platform is “supported” or the chair surrounded by sympathisers,
whose presence is esteemed favourable to “good
conditions”—a “nebulous term” better understood by
Spiritualists than the public. When the address is, as is
often the case, a miserable jumble of things inconsequential,
old, experienced Spiritualists say it is owing “to bad conditions,”
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, the influence of the audience on the speaker
being conflicting and bad, hence the inconclusive rambling
of the spirit’s oration. Whether this is the true explanation
or not, whether the medium was really controlled or not, or
the addresses successful or not, the fact remains that
Spiritualists admit that the “message” is not only “seriously
modified,” according to the channel (or medium) through
whom it is given, but that it may be deflected and distorted
by the influences of the audience to whom it is given.
Whatever the real cause of the imperfect oratory, what is
this but admitting <em>the thoughts transferred from the audience
to the sensitive either make or mar the utterance</em>? If spirit
utterance is thus influenced, it becomes a difficult matter to
decide how much of the original message has reached us as
intended, and how unwise it is for some to have their lives
directed by such uncertain counsel.</p>

<p>There are many persons so organised, that when they come
in contact with Spiritualism, (not knowing anything about
clairvoyance, psychometry, thought-transference, thought-reading,
etc.) are so convinced by what they hear and see
for the first time—so much out of the ordinary run of their
experience—the only way they can account for the phenomena
is, “that they must be the work of spirits, for no
human being could tell what they knew, or what they wanted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
save a spirit who could read their thoughts.” This is just
where, I think, the error creeps in. Those very revelations
which they in ignorance so readily attribute as only possible
coming from disembodied spirits, may be and are in some
instances quite possible to man, unaided by any such agency.</p>

<p>Many years ago I sat with Mr. David Duguid, the
Glasgow painting medium. I had a “direct spirit painting”
done. It was a correct—as far as I can recollect—painting
of a small farm-house and stead, in the North of Ireland,
where I as a child had been sent for my health. Neither Mr.
Duguid nor the control claimed to possess any actual knowledge
of me, or of the circumstances of my childhood. When
I had an opportunity of attending the seance in question, I
wondered if such a scene could be painted, and my wonder
was greater when it was done.</p>

<p>Here again, we have evidence of thought-transference.
Whether Mr. Duguid, by some occult power, caused the
direct painting to be done—his own spirit doing it while his
body was in the trance state—or the painting was produced
by one of his controls, I am not prepared to state. I am
willing to state my belief that the painting was not done
by Duguid, the medium, or any other person present in
the room. One of the controls of the medium claimed to
have painted the little sketch, and, truth to tell, it is not
more difficult to accept this hypothesis than “the spirit of
the medium did it.” In our ordinary experience of human
nature, we do not find it usual for men to give credit to
others—men or spirits—for what they are capable of doing
and saying themselves.</p>


<h3>REFLECTIONS.</h3>

<p>It is quite possible, seeing that out of this life into the
next, through the portals of death, pass all sorts and conditions
of human beings, that in the next stage of existence—most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
closely allied to that in which we now live—mankind
are not essentially different in character from what we
find now. It is not, therefore, necessary to call in the
agency of demons, as distinct from human spirits, to account
for the phenomena of Spiritualism. If in artificial somnambulism
and the phenomena of the psychic state the operating
agent is an embodied human spirit, it is possible the same
human spirit, albeit disembodied, may still retain power to
control or influence other human beings.</p>

<p>There is another and more serious matter for consideration,
concerning which our investigations of Spiritualism have
thrown little or no light—Spirit Identity. Not only do our
friends depart and never return, and many have promised to
do so. How far are we certain when spirits have returned?
We may have been deceived by our own impulsiveness,
anxiety, and desire to feel and to know that “they are not
lost but gone before.” Again, admitting the genuineness of
physical phenomena, and conceding that all the communications
are really made by disembodied spirits or intelligent
beings like unto ourselves, what proof do we possess that
they are really what they represent themselves to be, or
what they appear to be in spirit circles? “A bad or
mischievous spirit,” says Dr. Nichols, “may, for aught we
know, personate our friends, <em>penetrate our secrets</em>, and
deceive us with false representations.” This is certainly
worth thinking about. My object in writing is not to turn
my readers against Spiritualism, but to get them to bring
into the investigation judgment, not only to analyse evidence,
but the capacity to “judge not according to appearance, but
judge righteous judgment.” It is no part of my purpose to
deal with the history, ethics, or even the phenomena of
Spiritualism. That has been well done by others. I merely
write to show that Spiritualism “has something in it,” and is
of such importance that it is neither to be lightly rejected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
on the one hand, nor are its phenomena at all times to be
attributed to agency of disembodied spirits.</p>

<p>Spiritualism is a many-sided subject, and too vast in its
proportions to be dealt with here, and while I have no
doubt that its public mediumistic exponents are no more
perfect than the rest of humanity—much is laid at their door
which may have a basis on fact—yet I do think they often
suffer unjustly. Firstly, from the cries of the ignorant—educated
or otherwise, matters little—who charge them with
fraud, simply because such people are ignorant of the psychic
possibilities of man; and, secondly, from the admiring and
thoughtless many who are prepared to accept the commonest
of psychic phases instanter as evidence of “disembodied
spirit” presence and power. I have no doubt many
phenomena are quite explicable on natural grounds. Setting
aside the possibilities of self-deception in untrained observers,
and of fraud in dishonest mediums, and of genuine
phenomena traceable to the powers of the “spirit which is
within each of us,” there remains, to my mind, abundant
evidence of the existence of “discarnate spirit,” possessing
all the attributes of the human spirit, as we know ourselves
from the study of man as a psychological subject.
Unfortunately, the very best evidence in favour of both
“embodied” and “disembodied spirit” is not of that kind
which is available for publicity. Still, I hold, if there
is evidence (psychological and physical) for disembodied spirit
in Spiritualism, I am also satisfied there is abundant evidence
for embodied spirit in the psychological experiences of life,
apart from what we know of Spiritualism.</p>

<p>I may fitly close these reflections by quoting the
testimony of that keen scientific observer anent phenomenal
Spiritualism—namely, Cromwell F. Varley, Esq., F.R.S:—“Twenty-five
years ago I was a hard-headed unbeliever....
Spiritual phenomena, however, suddenly and quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
unexpectedly was soon after developed in my own family....
This led me to inquire, and to try numerous experiments
in such a way as to preclude, as much as circumstances
would permit, the possibility of trickery and self-deception.”...
He then details various phases of the phenomena
which had come within the range of his personal experience,
and continues:—“Other and curious phenomena had
occurred, proving the existence (<i>a</i>) of forces unknown to
science; (<i>b</i>) <em>the power of instantly reading my thoughts</em>; (<i>c</i>)
the presence of some intelligence or intelligences controlling
those powers.... That the phenomena occur there
is overwhelming evidence, and it is too late to deny their
existence.”</p>

<p>The Bibliography of Spiritualism is somewhat extensive.
What books are best to recommend to beginners is not
an easy matter to decide. “The Use of Spiritualism,” by
the late S. C. Hall, F.S.A.,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> however, will repay perusal,
and from the intellectual fitness, high moral tone, and spotless
reputation of the author, this book may be safely
recommended to all readers.</p>


<h3>THEOSOPHY.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></h3>

<p>I have been frequently asked, What is Theosophy? A
question more easily asked than answered, and in answering
I may do even less justice to it than to Spiritualism.
Theosophy is an intellectual speculation, having for its main
object the supplanting of Christianity, by a Revised Version of
Hindoo Metempsychosis. An attempt to foist upon our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>western ideas and exoteric habits of thought, the mysticisms
and esoteric speculations of the mystics of India and
Japan. Modern Spiritualism is not a religion. Theosophy
not only claims to be a religion, but to be “the essential
basis of all religions.” Modern Spiritualism may have its
faults, and be as imperfect as human souls are here or hereafter.
But we at least understand <a id="its"></a><ins title="Original has 'it'">its</ins> faults and defects. The
triple-crowned spiritual monarch—sitting on the seven hills
of Rome—is not more infallible than the principles which
underlie Theosophy—with its demi-gods, its Mahatmas, its
adepts, miracle workers and wonders. To not understand
and be able to accept these principles at once, is to proclaim
oneself an ignoramus. Theosophy is a strangely fascinating
religion for intellectual æsthetics.</p>

<p>Spiritualism is at least susceptible of being observed and
investigated, and the hypothesis of Spiritualism is naturally
a reasonable deduction from the facts. Not so Theosophy,
which is merely a theory, an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a priori</i> assumption pleasing
to those with more reflective and imaginative powers than
capacity for practical observation. Spiritualism has given
facts to be examined and tested, Theosophy nothing save
gigantic and baseless assertions. Its <em>astral shells</em> and
<em>elementals</em> are like its <i>Mahatmas</i>, flimsy phantasies, less
tangible than the ghost seen and described by Dr. Jessop,
or visions of the <em>shade of shades</em>, seen by psychometers.
For these latter we have at least a basis in psychic
phenomena.</p>

<p><em>Re-incarnation</em> is the back bone of Theosophy, and
Karma its necessary adjunct. The <i>Kismet</i> of Mahomet and
the doctrines of election of <a id="Calvinism"></a><ins title="Original has 'Calvanism'">Calvinism</ins> are not more
inexorable than the <i>Karma</i> of Theosophy. <i>Karma</i> is a
combination of earthly experiences and expiations of the
soul of man in time, during its everlasting process of
incarnating and re-incarnating in search of Wisdom, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
Eternal Reality, and the final extinction of all <em>individuality</em>
in the Nirvana. <i><a id="Devachan"></a><ins title="Original has 'Devachian'">Devachan</ins></i> is the intermediate state of
oblivion, in which <em>personality</em> is blotted out, and into which
the spiritual soul, etc., enters between the periods of
incarnation.</p>

<p>Theosophy—the Wisdom of God religion—attempts to
explain all the inequalities of life, the intellectual and moral
differences in men, of sin and suffering, by its working
theory, <em>Re-incarnation</em>, which doubtless has many attractive
features.</p>

<p>The phenomena Theosophists place so much reliance upon
are the property of mankind—somnambulism, psychic consciousness,
clairvoyance, psychometry, thought-transference,
etc. The “Theosophic miracles of communication with
persons in other parts of the world” are explicable by
thought-transference, and in time may be no more inherently
impossible than telegraphy without wires and poles.
The physical wonders of Theosophy, akin to those of
Spiritualism, are attributed to <em>shells</em>, the <em>astral</em> carcases of
once embodied but now rapidly dissolving <em>personality</em> of
man, and <em>elementals</em>, fragmentary spirit imps or sprites,
who up to the present have not been as yet incorporated
in some incarnated human soul.</p>

<p>As to the ethics of Theosophy, brotherly kindness, charity,
and self-sacrifice—most desirable virtues and <em>divine</em> attainments—are
neither new nor the special property of
Theosophy. Such <em>divine</em> qualities and virtues are common
to all religions and religious teaching, and if they ever
reached their climax in human form, they did in the person
of Jesus, the Lord’s Christ. He was the embodiment of
these, and a living example for all time, long, long before
unthinkable and “ungetatable” Mahatmas were announced
by Madame Blavatsky, or believed in by Mrs. Besant.</p>

<p>Theosophists recognise seven distinct parts in man, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
four transitory and three eternal. The transitory elements
are—the physical body, the vital principle, the <em>astral body</em>,
and the <em>animal soul</em>. These four comprise man’s <em>personality</em>,
and being transitory are perishable. Hence the <em>personality</em>
of man is annihilated at death. The three eternal elements
are—the <em>spirit</em>, the <em>spiritual soul</em>, and the <em>mind</em>. These
being imperishable form man’s <em>individuality</em>, and constitute
the immortal part of man. This immortal part <em>incarnates</em>
and <em>re-incarnates</em> throughout innumerable personalities on this
globe, and the rest of the planets, beside having alternate
periods of “rosy slumber” and of activity. Our <em>individuality</em>
has no sex, consequently we may be a little negro
wench in one incarnation, an Egyptian monarch in another,
a Nero in another, a John Knox in another, and so on.
Others may not progress, but sink from incarnation to incarnation,
from a mother in Israel, to a Deeming in Australia,
and, finally, to utter annihilation. Those good souls who
<em>live the life</em>, and perfect their souls through much suffering,
will become as one with “the Eternal Reality, the Rootless
Root of all that was, or is, or ever shall be.” The
higher and ever advancing Theosophist may, however,
stop short before he reaches the Nirvana, and elect to
become a Mahatma, or great soul, and reside on this or
some other planet to exercise power and precipitate wisdom,
by letters and otherwise, to the world, through chosen
adepts. The good Theosophist in this world and the next
is surrounded by “thought-forms,” which influence him in
his upward career. The Spiritualist has his departed friends
for guides, and the Christian (Spiritualist) is comforted by
“messengers sent forth to minister to them that are heirs of
salvation.” I don’t know that “thought-forms” administering
counsel to a spirit having no <em>personality</em> is an improvement
on the old ideas.</p>

<p>It is impossible to do justice to this Wisdom-Religion with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
its orders, grades, and bewildering phraseology. It is a
fancy religion for the intellectual, without a personal God or
a personal soul. Its circles are masonic lodges for the rich.
In no sense is it a religion to meet the wants of man as
man, like that founded on the life and death of Jesus Christ.
I do not pretend to explain Theosophy, for the task is
beyond me. It is a religion intended for those who realise
they are divine sparks of the Rootless Root, and not for the
common people, who are incapable of understanding a
system of morals thus veiled in allegory, and illustrated by
signs and symbols. Amid the perplexities of many words,
we learn that Theosophy teaches what St. Paul indicates
as the divine order of morals by the words: “Whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” To work out one’s
own salvation is as old as the race. We may all be Theosophists
without knowing it, as we don’t know who we are,
what we were, or who we are going to be, such is <i>Karma</i>.
Spiritualism and Theosophy are only referred to here seeing
how largely the phenomena on which they are based, is
explained by “How to Thought-Read.”</p>

Medicine in Transylvania University. In the year 1841 he made
several important discoveries in cerebral psychology, which he communicated
to the American and to the Edinburgh Phrenological

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[E]</a> Thought (says Professor Houston) is accompanied by molecular
vibrations in the grey matter of the brain, and these brain molecules,
like everything else, are immersed in and interpenetrated by ether; this
being so, their vibrations must set up wave-motions in the ether, and
these must spread out from the brain in all directions. Further, these
brain-waves, or thought waves, being thus sent out into space, will
produce some phenomena, and, reasoning by analogy we may expect
that—as in the case of sound-waves—sympathetic vibrations will be set
up in bodies similar to that which generates the waves, if those bodies
are attuned to respond. Again, reasoning by analogy, we may expect—as
in electric resonance—that such oscillations would be set up as are
found when electric waves are sent out and, meeting a circuit in consonance
with them, set up in that circuit oscillations like their own.</p>

<p>In view of these facts, which are well ascertained, he (Professor
Houston) considers that it does not seem improbable that a brain
engaged in intense thought should act as a centre for thought-radiation,
nor that these radiations, proceeding outwards in all directions, should
affect other brains on which they fall, provided that these other brains
are tuned to vibrate in unison with them.</p>

<p>Light waves are etheric vibrations, and it would seem that these
brain-waves should “partake of the nature of light.” If so, why should
it not be possible to obtain, say, by means of a lens, a photographic
impression of them?</p>

influence thoughts identical to those recorded.—<cite>English Mechanic.</cite></p>
